Ah, summer is approaching yet again, and as usual my skin turns from bright white to dark red. Sucks to be a whitey sometimes. Last cycling trip I didn't put sunscreen on my arms, thinking the northern European sun would be too weak to cause any problems. The trip before that I did put sunburn, and did not change color at all. This time they're bright red. I did put sunscreen on my face yet it didn't help as much. Today the skin on my face is peeling off. Last year it took me about a month to get my skin used to the sun, I hope it'll go a bit quicker this year.
