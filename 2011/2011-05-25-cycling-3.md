I have cycled for nearly every day for the past 2 weeks. Exceptions were rainy days and days that I went for a walk instead (which were not many). My usual trip around the lake went a lot easier than before the Sicily trip, more proof that I became fitter. Every day cycling seems to get easier, and I've been adding little pieces onto my route day by day, expanding a 25km route into a 40km one. I'm still very overweight, but I'm also fit. A strange combination.
