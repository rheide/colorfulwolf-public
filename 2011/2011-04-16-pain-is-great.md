Ah, there it is again. That familiar pain in the legs I can only get after cycling for at least a couple of hours at a decent speed. It's very faint and not really painful at all, it just serves as a reminder that I already cycled a lot and that I'm still cycling. The pain almost never gets worse than a certain threshold, and then remains constants. Well, unless I cycle up a 10% incline, that is. This pain is a very important part of cycling to me. Without it there would be no satisfaction in climbing a slope, no relaxation in going down a hill. I enjoy it.

Leaving for Sicily on Friday. I'm still in extremely poor shape, but I regained my confidence. I'll get tired as hell but my physical condition improved enough to endure it. Now I can truly look forward to it.
