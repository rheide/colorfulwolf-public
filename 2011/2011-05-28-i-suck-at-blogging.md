I wrote a rather deep post two days ago, then I couldn't post it because internet was broken. The next morning I chickened out and deleted it. For a lifeblog I haven't posted anything meaningful about my life recently. I'm quite appalled at myself. I hope that I'll have the chance one of these days to post a proper update.
