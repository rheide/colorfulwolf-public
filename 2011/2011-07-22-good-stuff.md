Today was a beautiful day with great weather, and London was a joy to be in. But since I didn't take any photos today here's some horribly gloomy ones of yesterday instead.

Incidentally, today was my first day at my new job. Incidentally, I have a new job. It's such a difference from my previous job that I feel as if I've "switched sides". For the Â better, that is. More about this later when I can be bothered to write something down.
