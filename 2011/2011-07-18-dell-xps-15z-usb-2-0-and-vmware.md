Just thought I'd share something obvious here: the Dell XPS 15z does in fact have a USB 2.0 port! I didn't realize it until now, but there's a USB port hidden inside the eSata connector, right next to the USB 3.0 ports. Can't believe I didn't notice it before.. Anyway, this is good news, because you can use that port to connect devices to your virtualized OS that's running in VMWare. If, for example, you're developing an iPhone app in VMWare MacOS, then it's very useful to be able to connect an actual device for debugging.
