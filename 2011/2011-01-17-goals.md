Now that I'm back to my parent's house again I'm afraid I'll lose my momentum, so I wrote down what I want to change about my life.
<ul>
	<li>Go running twice a week. Get clothes to run in the rain.</li>
	<li>Do a cycling day-trip every week (at least 60km), if weather permits.</li>
	<li>Work on programming/business ideas instead of procrastinating on the internet.</li>
	<li>Make enough money for myself to fund a trip to London each month (est. ~400GBP).</li>
	<li>Work on a long-term idea that has very little chance of succeeding, but do it anyway because it's exciting.</li>
	<li>Less snacks, more chewing gum.</li>
	<li>Swimming might be nice.</li>
</ul>
I think some of these goals are unrealistic, but if I can accomplish at least some of these, I will be quite satisfied.
