Moodlogger 1.2 is now available on <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/moodlogger/id439120675?mt=8&amp;ls=1">iTunes</a> and on <a href="http://www.moodlogger.net/">moodlogger.net</a>! I added a whole bunch of things to the new version, hoping that I can work on improving the website from now on without having to worry about releasing a new version of the app. Here's the most important changes:
<ul>
	<li>Offline mode. Registration is now optional (though you'll miss out on all the cool web stats if you don't register)</li>
	<li>History view showing a list of recent moods (delete-able)</li>
	<li>More moodset graphics added, hooray for Steven Seagal!</li>
	<li>Location logging! No stats on that yet but there will be a ton of cool things that you'll be able to do if you turn this on.</li>
</ul>
Thanks everyone for trying it! I hope the project can really take off after this.
