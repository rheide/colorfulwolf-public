I thought I'd try out ads on this blog, just to see how much I would earn from them. Lately my traffic has been going up again, and this site's consistently doing 100+ visitors a day. I know, that's not a lot, but still. This site's been accumulating traffic over time, since I still have all the articles online that I wrote even five years ago. A lot of traffic comes from search engines rather than from regular readers.

As I mentioned before, I was mostly curious about the amount of money these ads would make. I never had any intention of leaving them there for the long term. After 2 weeks I've decided that it's enough. I've made a whopping 3 euros. Now I can retire. I'm sure you'll all enjoy the site a lot better without those nagging ads.
