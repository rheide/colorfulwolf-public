I have a hard time accepting happiness sometimes. I'm always afraid it will suddenly disappear again. But lately, nothing can go wrong. There's so much things going right in my life right now that I'd have a hard time listing them all, so let me just give you a short anecdote.

Yesterday I went to the gym. And it's just perfect. High-tech equipment, towels, decent showers, shampoo, everything's provided. It overlooks the streets of London and I could see the sun setting as I was running for my life. Afterwards I grabbed a free drink and headed back to HQ where I had left my laptop. I walked a leisurely pace back towards the subway station, went down the stairs, looked around, saw a train waiting there. In a split second I saw that it was heading to my station, which is about a 1 in 4 chance, and I jumped on it. As my last foot entered the train the doors started to close. There was plenty of room to sit as it was well after commuting hours. I read a nice book on the way back and enjoyed the walk home alongside the park. I didn't bother going to bed early because I was working from home the next day, saving me the time needed to commute. Not that I mind working in the office, mind you. The place is filled with smart young people from all over the world. It's like AK, without the management, with more rewarding work (and the pressure that comes with it). 

I hope you don't think I'm writing this to boast, because I'm not. I'm writing this down because I'm not used to things going my way, so this kind of stuff happening to me I consider quite rare. I'm never quite sure if I deserved it. But this is how it is. I somehow landed myself in a situation that I am rather comfortable with. There's much more to that statement than just my work situation, of course, but perhaps I'll talk about that some other time. For now, I can't help but think: Life is good. Enjoy it.
