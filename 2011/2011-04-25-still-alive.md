Cycled ahead of the storm today with huge winds pushing us forward, and sometimes sideways into the path of a passing car. The winds also made it very dusty and sandy which killed my eyes. Here's some other random notes i feel I should blog about before I forget them.
<ul>
	<li>I actually enjoyed the uphill/downhills more than droning on the long flat roads.</li>
	<li>We're fairly on schedule, but according to the weather report every day from now on will be rain and thunder.</li>
	<li>Accommodation on Sicily seems to be fairly cheap compared to the rest of Europe. For 20eur you can have a very nice room, quite unlike Amsterdam or Antwerp.</li>
	<li>Tim is a mad cycling monster.</li>
	<li>Pizza was good.</li>
</ul>

92km today. Tomorrow we'll either aim for 100 or get stuck in the storm and not do anything at all. More later!
