I feel thoughtful but I can't find the right words to write. Someone suggested I write down the general gist of what I think I should write about at the moment and then write the actual blogpost at some later time, but I don't think I should do that. I sometimes write sticky notes to myself with ideas for a blog post, but I never end up actually posting them on my blog. I think today I'll leave it at this, and wait for the next solitudonal moment for my next real thoughtful blogpost. 

A lot of things are happening in my life lately, and they're still all good.
