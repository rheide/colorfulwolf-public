Last week my screen suddenly gained several large vertical lines of dead pixels on the right side of my screen. Since my laptop is only a few months old, I was not very happy with that. I called tech support yesterday and scheduled for my laptop to be fixed. Dell will fix it within 2 weeks for free, but if you pay 30 pounds they'll come by the next day and fix it on-site, which is exactly what they did. I am now starting at a lovely new screen that was very expertly attached by the Dell repairman. The repairman told me the XPS 15Z is the hardest one to fix because all the components are so cramped together inside the case. Very funny guy, very good service.

Now, the dreadful call to Virgin Media again..
