I watched this anime called <a href="http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&amp;aid=4708" target="_blank">Freedom</a> recently. It's beyond visually stunning, as you can see from <a href="http://vimeo.com/19912151" target="_blank">the intro</a>.

The story was decent, the execution a bit less, but all in all it was very entertaining. The creators really did go out of their way to go from a situation of no freedom at all to a situation of total freedom, which is brilliant. It's only 7 episodes, go watch it in HD.
