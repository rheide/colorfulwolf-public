Those two round things are the earpieces of a Beyer Dynamic DT770 Pro headphone. It's a bit broken. The sound on the right channel is extremely weak. I suspected it to be a faulty wire, but haven't been able to prove it. It seems more like a faulty driver now, so I'm not sure if I'll be able to fix it. I'm accepting suggestions for a new headphone.. :(
