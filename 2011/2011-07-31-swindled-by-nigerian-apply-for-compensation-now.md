I've been getting tons of spam in my spam folder ever since I <a href="/blog/2011/06/15/i-nearly-got-scammed/">nearly got scammed</a> a couple of weeks ago. I usually delete spam immediately but this one was just too audacious. It's a royal meta-scam, this one. The mail was titled: <em>Swindled by Nigerian? Apply for compensation now!</em>

Dear Sir/Madam

This is to announce to you that the Federal Government of Nigeria supported by the World Bank Group and International Monetary Fund (IMF) have allocated $50.000 each for every scam victims for monetary loss and damages.

The compensation funds were deposited at Citibank Nigeria (CN) and the funds will be transferred free of charge by Citibank Nigeria (CN) as instructed by the Federal Government of Nigeria so you do not need to pay any transfer fee or tax of any kind and the transfer will also be monitored by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for confirmation reasons. The funds have been insured to avoid unnecessary deductions until they get to their various destinations.

Take note that we have never held any scam victims compensation program in Nigeria. This is the First-Of-Its-Kind. Do not be deceived by anybody, any organization or any Ministry!

If you have been scammed send your NAME and ADDRESS for verification to any of the two (2) email addresses listed below, the email addresses are set up by Citibank Nigeria (CN) for this compensation purpose only:

Email1:   citi-nigeria.cn@9.cn
Email2:   cn.citinigeria@9.cn

***The means of verification is via Western Union and MoneyGram, if truly you have sent money to Nigeria your name will be in their database***

Please do not respond to any email which asks you to send your username and password for any reason, if you have already done that kindly change your password immediately.

Yours sincerely,
Mrs. Irewolede Janet Michael
(Public Relations Officer)
Oversea Communication Department
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), Nigeria.

I don't whether I should laugh or cry. The .cn domain is of course not Citibank Nigeria, it's China. Do people ever use Western Union for anything that is not illegal? During my entire life online I have only ever seen Western Union mentioned in combination with scammers. I really don't know how they stay in business.
