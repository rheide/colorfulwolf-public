Had a nice run-in with a buddy yesterday who also spent some time in Japan in the past. Although we never met while we were in Japan, and our situations were not exactly the same, we did find a whole bunch of similarities. One of those similarities was how we used to take photos of every little thing. An urge which seems to have completely disappeared after moving to London. In compensation for that I hereby present you the only two photos I took of my 'new life' in London that I haven't shared yet.

It's a long shot from the world of wonder I found myself in 5 years ago, but I'll do my best to log my experiences here. After all, what's the point of having a blog if you don't update it?
