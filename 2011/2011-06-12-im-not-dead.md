Contrary to popular belief I am not dead yet, despite having shown no online signs of life for the past week or so. I've been on holiday to the Seychelles. Most of the time there was no internet connection available, and the rest of the time I felt that I could enjoy the holiday more by being disconnected. This was true. Being on a tropical island MUST be enjoyed without feeling the need to check your e-mail every day. I highly recommend everyone to disconnect themselves every once a while. And yes, that includes your smart phone as well.

(More Seychelles photos and stories soon :) )
