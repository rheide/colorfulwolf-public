Tomorrow my short stay in London is at an end. I will be returning to the Holland, where I will live with my parents for a while. The last time I returned to Holland I had mixed feelings about it, but this time I am certain of my path. I know where I'm supposed to go next, and I know which way I want my life to flow to. This year's planning is beginning to take shape, and I have a very good feeling about it.

Time to start!
