So, somebody hacked the PS3. Sony's answer: <a href="http://www.techspot.com/news/42317-sony-demands-identities-from-google-twitter-in-ps3-hacking-lawsuit.html" target="_blank">SUE EVERYONE! </a>If you watched the youtube video showing how to hack the PS3, beware. Sony demands the IP addresses of everyone who viewed or commented on the youtube video.

Those who know me know that this kind of behaviour from a company does not sit well with me. And Sony was not exactly the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_BMG_copy_protection_rootkit_scandal" target="_blank">perfect role model</a> in the past, but this is just way over the top. They sure know how to alienate their customer base.

For the record: I was thinking about buying a PS3 solely for playing Gran Turismo 5, which I'm sure is an awesome game and I really want to play it. Because of this I have decided not to buy a PS3, or any other Sony product, ever again. Well done Sony. Go pat yourself on the back.
