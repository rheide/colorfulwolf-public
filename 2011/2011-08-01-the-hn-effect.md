The post about the Nigerian meta-scam enjoyed a brief period on the front page of <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/news" target="_blank">Hacker News</a> yesterday, which always brings massive amounts of traffic. The post fell down to the second page rather quickly, after which the traffic died down a bit, but today the post got picked up by the <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/financial-adviser/2011/08/01/8-unusual-must-reads-for-monday-morning-2/" target="_blank">Wall Street Journal</a>, causing another influx of traffic.

Not bad, but not nearly as popular as <a href="/blog/2011/05/31/resources-are-being-utterly-and-completely-wasted-on-mining-bitcoins/">this bitcoin article</a> I wrote a while back. During the height of its popularity the server couldn't handle the load and got very slow. Serves me right for refusing to pay more for hosting. In fact, I think it held up remarkably well.

&lt;/geek dick comparison&gt;

It's events like these that make me happy that I'm still blogging.
