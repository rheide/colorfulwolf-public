It's freezing again, which means that I am once again too hot. This may sound like a contradiction, so I will explain. When it's freezing my parents turn up the central heating, which creates a fairly nice temperature throughout the house, but in my room (which is directly under the roof) it gets too hot. It doesn't help that I have a PC in the room that's always running at 100% capacity. Today I added this optimization between my balcony door and PC:

No, I did not drill that hole there just for my PC. In the summer that tube is connected to an airconditioning unit. In winter, I can use it to cool my PC and prevent the room from heating up too much. Results so far: CPU temps have dropped ~4C and the GPU fan is running at 40% instead of 44%. Meh.
