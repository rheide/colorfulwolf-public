I just remembered something I haven't ranted about yet! Last time when I went back to Holland, I used my Oyster card to travel to Gatwick airport, only to find out upon entering the airport that I couldn't use my Oyster to pay there. Instead, as the wannabe security person told me, I had to get out at a previous station and buy a regular ticket for the remainder of the journey. Then he charged me 20 pounds for not traveling with a valid ticket. This is retarded for several reasons:
<ul>
	<li>At no time before reaching the airport was I notified that I couldn't use my Oyster card.</li>
	<li>They could've just charged me for the remainder of the journey.</li>
</ul>
How many tourists are falling for this trap every day and are forced to pay bribe money to the British rail service? I cannot help but compare this to Japan, where if the same thing happened, a Japanese rail official would apologize for not having a Suica (Oyster) card reader in place at the station, and then deduct me for only the remainder of the journey.
