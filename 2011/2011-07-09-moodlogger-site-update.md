The <a href="http://www.moodlogger.net/" target="_blank">moodlogger </a>website now had a minor design change. I fixed the trouble that was introduced when adding new moodsets and moods, and the <a href="http://www.moodlogger.net/u/rv/" target="_blank">user stats page</a> looks pretty again.

The main new feature that's been added is that users can now select whether or not they want to share their moods publicly, or keep their stats page private only to members or only to themselves. The same page will also allow you to change your e-mail address.

Oh, and I added a Donate button to the <a href="http://www.moodlogger.net/about">about </a>page. Please give me money! :)
