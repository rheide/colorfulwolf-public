<a href="http://publicnoises.blogspot.com/2009/05/david-foster-wallace-kenyon.html">A speech on how to deal with the tedium of daily life  and still keep an open mind.</a>
It might be a bit long but it's definitely worth the read. I certainly recognized myself in some of the situations described. It <em>is</em> really difficult to remain <a href="/blog/2011/03/17/are-you-awake/">awake</a> when you're at the supermarket, waiting in line after a long day of work. Some people are, like mentioned in the speech, defaulting their behaviour to not being awake, and there's all kinds of reasons for that. Personally, I do everything I can to avoid tedious, boring, 'supermarket' situations like that exactly because I know it will numb my brain. Stay awake, people!
