I was walking to work this morning and I spotted an semi-old British lady going the opposite way. As we neared each other she started walking slower and eventually stopped. I thought she was going to ask me something so I slowed down too. For a second she didn't say anything while I gazed at her while waiting for her to speak. Then she smiled and said:
<blockquote>"You have such a satisfied look on your face!"</blockquote>
I said "Thank you", and walked on.
