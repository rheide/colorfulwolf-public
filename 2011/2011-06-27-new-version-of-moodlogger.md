Well, it's not quite released yet, but the updated app is pending review. I added a whole bunch of new moods as well as the ability to select from different sets of moods. I wanted to do a lot more, like implement an offline mode, clarify the registration procedure, add twitter/facebook connectivity etc. But I just don't have the time right now. I made preparations in this version for the offline feature though, and I also made it a whole lot easier for me to release new moods and new moodsets without having to update the app; everything just downloads from the server automatically, meaning it's a whole lot easier now to do incremental updates.

The <a href="http://www.moodlogger.net/">website </a>didn't change in terms of design, but the back-end was changed quite a bit to support mood sets and the soon-to-be-introduced offline mode. There's still some work to be done, but fortunately I can do it while/after the app's been reviewed, giving me a bit more time.

I've been thinking about starting a dev blog, but since there's precious little to report if I don't have time to work on it, I've decided to keep all the Moodlogger reports here on CFW for now. Hopefully I'll have some more to tell you later.
