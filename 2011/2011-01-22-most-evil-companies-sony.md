Thank you, evil Sony bastards, for <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/hardware/sony-kills-virtualization-on-vaio-notebooks/5137" target="_blank">disabling hardware virtualization</a> on my Sony Vaio laptop. Thank you also for not giving me an option in the bios to turn it on. I'm so happy that I cannot run VMWare in hardware virtualization mode, preventing me from running Snow Leopard on my laptop. Sony, you suck.
