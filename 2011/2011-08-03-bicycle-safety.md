I've had a flat tire twice in the past two weeks. Both times it was after leaving my bicycle in an area that I didn't think was very safe, and both those times it was most likely just my own fault. I parked my bike at the station again today, and I felt extremely relieved after coming back that it was still there and in one piece. My two flat tires and countless warnings from friends about how unsafe London is for bicycles have made me wary about leaving my bicycle anywhere. But is that justified? I'm still hoping it isn't, but I'm not keen to find out.
