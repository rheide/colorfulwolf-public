Had a bit of time today and decided to work on Moodlogger for a bit. The new version is awaiting approval in the app store. The new version has two new features:
<ul>
	<li>Moods are now ordered by category, and you can swipe up and down to switch between positive, neutral and negative moods.</li>
	<li>I added a Stats tab which shows you your online statistics.</li>
</ul>
The statistics tab will prove very useful in the future, as I can update its contents without having to release a new app (and waiting to get it approved every time..). I'm planning to add a map to the stats view as soon as I find more time. It'd be really cool if you could add/remove/change locations to your moods on the fly. Hopefully coming soon :)
