<a href="http://kev.inburke.com/kevin/site-redesign/" target="_blank">Kevin Burke talks about how to improve your personal site for various audiences.</a>

Inspired by the article I added zipping,minifying and caching plugins to this blog, and it looks like the <a href="http://pagespeed.googlelabs.com/#url=http_3A_2F_2Fcolorfulwolf.com_2Fblog&amp;mobile=false">speed </a>has indeed improved.

I'm thinking about adding a front page directly on the cfw.com root that will show the most recent posts and some information about me any my projects, but I have a huge backlog of dev-related things already. Maybe some other time..
