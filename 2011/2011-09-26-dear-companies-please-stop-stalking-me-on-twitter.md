It's happened to me several times now that companies (I won't give names, although it's pretty easy to ascertain) have responded to one of my tweets about them. My tweets about companies are usually variations of the following format:
<blockquote>DAMN YOU COMPANY X, I CAN'T DO Y AND YOU SUCK ##*&amp;%*#</blockquote>
Now, the fact that I am tweeting something like this does not mean that I have exhausted all my lifelines and am shouting to the world for help in the ever so slight chance that somebody will read it and my message will somehow reach the highest executive of company X, who would then immediately help me get rid of my problem and offer me a thousand blue M&amp;Ms.

No, I am tweeting in frustration because the situation can in fact not be improved in any easy way. And in the one occasion in the past where a company contacted me via Twitter about a problem I was having, it turned out they couldn't help and told me to call. Yeah, I already knew that. That's part of my frustration, because the problem I was having was really simple.

Um, I got way too rational there.
