March 2011: one of the heaviest earthquakes ever recorded hits the Japanese mainland and does massive amounts of damage. The Japanese people behave in an orderly fashion and help each other deal with the crisis.

August 2011: one guy gets shot by the police in London and riots break out, resulting in the destruction of property and massive lootings.

	<li>This is supposed to be a first world country. Why are people looting and plundering?</li>
	<li>Aw, fuck it. I'm just very disappointed.</li>
</ol>
