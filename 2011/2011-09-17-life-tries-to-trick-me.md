But it failed! See:
<ul>
	<li>No power in kitchen area and can't find circuit breaker. Ha! I don't ever cook anyway!</li>
	<li>Got the results from the JLPT back: failed. Ha! I already knew that and I'm studying for the next one!</li>
</ul>
Good news on that last topic, as I apparently got the bare minimum points required for each section in the JLPT, meaning I don't have to worry too much about failing a particular section horribly. Of the total score I got 83 points out of 180, and the passing grade is 90. I'm close. I'm already studying kanji quite a lot on the train to work, and now I know that I have a fair chance of passing even if I don't improve on kanji, but focus on the easier areas instead. In December I will pass.
