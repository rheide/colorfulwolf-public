I used to host a bunch of my private projects on Unfuddle, which is a great website for hosting personal projects that have potential for growth that are also novel ideas that might generate revenue. In practice though, those ideas tend to be forgotten after a while and die a silent death. I received some e-mails from unfuddle about old projects of mine that were about to expire, so I decided to share them on <a href="https://github.com/rv" target="_blank">my github account</a> instead and make them open-source. Feel free to do anything you like with it :)
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.rankkeeper.com/" target="_blank">Rankkeeper</a> was an attempt at creating a generic media-rating website Ã  la <a href="http://www.anime-planet.com" target="_blank">Anime Planet</a></li>
	<li>Goalkeeper was a scheduler/time tracker that was supposed to use the pomodoro technique to help people keep track of what they do. It was a cooperative project that ever really came off the ground.</li>
	<li>The Android client for <a href="www.moodlogger.net" target="_blank">Moodlogger</a> is actually a work-in-progress, but I don't have a lot of time recently and other people have expressed their interest in developing an Android version, so here you go.</li>
