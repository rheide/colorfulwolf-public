Isn't it weird how sometimes nothing happens for weeks, then suddenly in a span of two days a series of events happen that completely changes your life? I'm in one of those moments right now, and events just seem to be piling up, both personally and professionally. That's the roller coaster of life, I guess. All I can do is ride it like a boss.
