In preparation for the Sicily trip we cycled 30km to Watford (and 30 back). The road lead us alongside a canal all the way, and was at times a bit too rocky and bumpy for touring bicycles. That fact was effectively proven by Kamil getting a flat tire on the way back.

Although we have the same bicycle, Kamil hasn't used his for years, so there's quite a few differences now. He still has the original tires, which are thinner in width and slightly less meaty compared to mine. In my case almost everything except the frame has been replaced. The thing that is the most broken on my bike is also the thing I missed most today: the suspension. My arms are still shaking...
