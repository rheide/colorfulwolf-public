So it seems that I must create my own Haar classifier for detecting text. Haar classifiers are used to detect faces in images, and as such there's a whole bunch of source code available that does the detection. I found a nice Java library called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jjil/" target="_blank">jjil</a> which can do the detection, provided I supply it with a haar classifier. Let's see if I can cook one up.
