How strange. No deep reflection this year. No massive new year's eve party either. Just hanging out with friends. It's different from what I had thought would happen, but it's not half bad. Certainly a good starting point for 2011.

To all my friends out there reading this, I wish you a happy 2011. It's truly a new year with new chances, as clich√© as it sounds. A lot of interesting things will happen this year, I promise you that.

Extra hard reflection? Did I write that? I'm very sleepy.
