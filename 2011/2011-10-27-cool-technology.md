I own an iPad 2 and an Android phone: the Google Nexus S. When I think about cool and awesome technology, I think immediately of the iPad 2. When I think of a plastic lump of turd, I think of my Android phone. Android is just not cool yet. Why? Also, the user experience on iOS is so much better than Android, it's not even funny any more. I would much rather see Android be successful than iOS, but the Android 4.0 had better be real damn good, otherwise I'll be forced to buy a bloody iPhone...
