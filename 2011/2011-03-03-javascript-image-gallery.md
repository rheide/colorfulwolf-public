I added a Javascript image gallery using <a href="http://sorgalla.com/jcarousel/" target="_blank">jcarousel</a>. I'm not entirely happy with the CSS, but it works, and that's what matters to me. Here it is.

<strong>Thumbnails</strong>

[jsgallery size="thumbnail"]

<strong>Medium</strong>

[jsgallery size="medium"]

The CSS is not cooperating well here. I'd rather have a dynamic height, but I need to spend some time on that to get it to work.

<strong>Large</strong>

[jsgallery size="large" include="3822,3823,3826,3828"]

These are the photos of the <a href="/blog/2010/04/16/snow/" target="_blank">coldest day</a> of the cycling trip I did last year. The location is the west side of Mount Fuji. It was one snowy, icy trip all the way down to sea level from ~1000 meters up. A day I will probably never forget :)
