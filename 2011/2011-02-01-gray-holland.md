What is about Holland that makes it just not fun to go out? Is it the cold weather? The gray sky? The continuous rain? The strong winds? The long boring stretches of road?

All of the above.

I am in poor physical shape, and I am doing another cycling trip in April. I will have to train a lot, but the motivation is just not there right now.
