<ul>
	<li>I'd keep enough for myself so I can life comfortably and choose freely how I live my life.</li>
	<li>I'd give enough to my parents so they can do the same.</li>
	<li>I'd give a little to my little sister so she can have a safety cushion while she chooses her life's path.</li>
	<li>I'd invest into a company that my UK friends will create, and I will finally convince (and enable) them to quit their jobs.</li>
	<li>I'd use however much is still left to start a software company in Japan and hire some of my old buddies from AK time.</li>
	<li>Aforementioned company would of course have an internship program that would fetch students from universities all over the world (and a Japanese teacher on the payroll too!).</li>
	<li>Said company would create something that will change the world for the better (which is NOT the next facebook). The bright minds gathered there would think of something, I am sure of that.</li>
	<li>Finally, I'd buy a certain someone a crappy second hand Mini Cooper just to annoy her :D</li>
	<li>Once all of that is set up and I have free time again, I'd get back on my bicycle and cycle around the world.</li>
</ul>
If someone just walked up to me and offered me 10 million, this is exactly what I would do. My dream, if you will. Cheaper than some, more expensive than others.

(It's all your fault Kamil! For talking to me about winning the lottery...)
