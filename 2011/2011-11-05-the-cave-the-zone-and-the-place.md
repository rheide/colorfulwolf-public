<a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2006/07/10/a_nerd_in_a_cave.html">A Nerd in a Cave.</a> This is one of those articles I read and simply cannot believe how much of it is about me. I have a Cave as described in the article. I get cranky just like that when people interrupt me when I'm in the Zone (and I've on occassion Snapped at people, sorry about that &gt;_&lt;;) and I have a Place to get away from it all and charge my energy. I'm glad to see there's more people having the same environmental needs as I do. His last sentiment rings very true as well:
<blockquote>The risk with these places is the same risk with all comfortable places. In the comfort, we forget that some of the most interesting stuff happens elsewhere.</blockquote>
