Someone just called me on my home phone, which is a number I've not given to anybody nor do I even remember (or use) myself. The conversation was brief but to the point.

Me: Hello?

Caller: Y0u're a dick.

Me: Who is this?

Caller: ... Who do you think it is?

Me: Your mother.

And then I hung up.
