I'm going back to Holland soon. While I enjoy the time I spend with my friends in London a lot, it is in fact cheaper to visit them once a month than to live here. As all my friends are quite technical, talking to them always leads to interesting areas that may lead to a profitable business. Be it iPhone applications, ideas for a website or service, Android, hardware, anything. The ideas flow freely Â and I'm free to take my pick and try to develop them. The feeling of freedom is great.

So I've got plenty of time, the ideas started flowing in, now I need to set up my working place. I rather regret that I bought a new PC just before I quit my job. It'll come in handy for whatever I'm going to do next, but I'm really thinking about going ultra-mobile. I guess I just want to go back to that cycling-trip feeling of being able to go wherever I want, whenever I want. I may consider swapping my PC for a powerful laptop. So if anyone's interested in a brand-new i7 950 system with SSD and Radeon HD6870 let me know.

On a side note, I recently had the opportunity to play with an iPad. I tried it before when it first came out in the beginning of 2010, and also a while back at the Apple store in London. As much as I would like to hate Apple for being evil and too expensive and whatnot, there's just nothing bad I can say about the iPad. It really is incredibly good. Everyone I know who has tried the iPad has become addicted to it immediately. I might just have to get one for myself...

Travel plans have been made! This summer is going to be another fun holiday to an exotic destination! I can't wait till summer...
