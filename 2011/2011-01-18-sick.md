I am sick. I have a fever, the shivers, a very nasty cough, and occasionally a runny nose. It's the first time in years that I've been this sick. I'm quite enjoying it.

It's probably some type of flu. I cough a lot, and the head movements are giving me a headache. My body is quite lethargic, and every little move I make seems to take a bit more effort than usual. I'm enjoying it because I rarely get this sick (never got the flu once while in Japan), so it's like a new experience to me. A nice little bit of information about my body that I get to analyze. My conclusion: I'm not immune to flu. Bummer.
