Google Earth is amazing! I was mapping the route we cycled in Sicily and found out it has a built-in altitude display that shows the exact elevation of a path. All you have to do is right-click the path and click 'Show Elevation Profile'. I love Google Earth. Here's the route we did, and <a href="https://www.colorfulwolf.com/sicily/Sicily.kmz">here is the kmz file</a> you can use to view the path in Google Earth.

Note that neither the route nor the elevation is entirely accurate. The reason the paths may be inaccurate is because I may have misremembered some of the roads we took. The reason the elevation is inaccurate is because it doesn't take into account tunnels or bridges. The elevation image shows us descending down into deep values and ascending over high mountains but in truth we were just taking the bridges and tunnels conveniently placed there for us.
