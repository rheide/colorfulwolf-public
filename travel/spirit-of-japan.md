This page is about the trip that I’ve dubbed ‘the spirit of Japan’ in my mind. In March 2010 I will finally quit my job as programmer, after four enjoyable years of working in Japan. Not knowing what to do with my life, I will start cycling until I find out. First I will head to Kyoto, then Hiroshima, then Kyushu. After that, who knows?
