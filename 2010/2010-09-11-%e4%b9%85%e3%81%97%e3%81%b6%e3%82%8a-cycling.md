Today was quite a nice day. It's been cloudy and raining for a long time now, but today was perfect weather for cycling. Well, except for the wind. And the clouds. And all those annoying old people on bicycles that don't move out of the way for me even after I ring my bell. But really, it was quite nice.

I found that while on my bicycle I have this peculiar habit of extending my right arm behind my back to feel if my luggage is still there. It's a habit I picked up while cycling in Japan with a huge amount of stuff behind me, and after driving over bumps I'd check that it didn't fell off. Doing the same thing while carrying no luggage at all just makes me look silly.
