My occasional fears have become a reality: I am the last of the Asahi Kasei interns/foreigners to remain in Atsugi. It seems unreal that there is really no one else left. I just can't wrap my mind around it. Sometimes I get the feeling that after I'm gone this beautiful place will really disappear and nobody will remember it.

I got mildly annoyed at having to buy a 4-pack of toilet paper even though I am leaving next week. It's only 200 yen but it seems like such a waste. It's not about money, and it's not about whether or not it'll be used, as the next owner of this apartment will find it useful, but something about the idea of buying 4 rolls of toilet paper and using only 1 does not sit well with me.

If you go to the supermarket after 21:00 all the pre-prepared food is half price. In other words: you can eat twice as much for the same price.

It's raining again today. I've watched movies, sorted out my music, downloaded some games, and surfed the internet. Even though I am completely free to do whatever I want I choose to stay inside my room and do stuff that I would otherwise do. Interesting.

I'm going to a party on Saturday with some friends. I chose to stay in Atsugi for five more days because of this party. In retrospect, this was the right decision because today's weather absolutely sucks and tomorrow will probably not be any better. Despite that I suddenly feel the urge to leave right now. After my last foreigner friends left I suddenly feel that it's enough, and I must go.

Concerning what kind of food to bring on the trip: chocolate paste is good at temperatures lower than 30C and can be kept for a long time. Jam is only good under 10C according to the label, and my subconscious tells me it will attract more bugs. If I am ever bored I will experiment with this.

I forgot to mention this in the last post about immigration, but I got my visa transferred from my old passport to my new one, so now I only have to bring my new passport on the trip. Me so happy.

Next Thursday is the ultimate deadline for my room. I will leave on Monday.
