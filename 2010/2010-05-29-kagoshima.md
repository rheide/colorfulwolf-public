I was about 5 kilometers south of Kagoshima yesterday, so it was a relaxed trip towards the city center today. I cycled around the port area and wandered around the city a bit. I used my time today to take care of a bunch of loose ends, and most of the things I wanted to do are done, except that I can't transfer my money back to Holland because the banks are closed on weekends, which is stupid.

In the afternoon I met Nishi to talk about our plans to travel to Yakushima. He took me to his place, and kindly offered me a place to stay. Excellent! Nishi has some awesome cool stuff in his place like a 3d mouse, an awesome desk chair that doesn't make you want to get up ever again and even an iPad! I am liking the iPad more than I want to admit...

In the late afternoon I went out again and took this timelapse of Sakurajima. Unlike last time there's no focus problems or exposure issues, but the upload to Youtube seems to have reduced the quality a lot. I found out that the battery of an S90 lasts for about two hours when taking a photo every 10 seconds. I spent my time reading a book while the camera was taking photos. During the time lapse I had two weird encounters with old men. They both tried to start a conversation with me on separate occassions, and both times they started mumbling to themselves and spoke in such a weird accent that I lost track of what they were saying. Strange.
