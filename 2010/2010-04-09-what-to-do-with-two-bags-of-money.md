</div>

Japanese banks suck for any number of reasons. I'll list the ones that frustrated me here:
<ul>
	<li>They're not open on weekends. This is retarded.</li>
	<li>On weekdays they close early in the afternoon.</li>
	<li>You can deposit money from the ATM, but you have to insert each coin individually.</li>
	<li>The counter that handles bulk deposits is only open in the morning.</li>
	<li>This counter requires that you bring your bank book, just your cash card is not enough.</li>
</ul>
How can it be that in Japan all the small things are so convenient, but all the large institutions suck donkeyballs?

So, I went to the bank today (in the afternoon, without my bank book), and they couldn't help me deposit this massive amount of money into my bank account. I will probably have another chance to make a deposit before I leave, but this whole 'inconvenient bank' thing has left me thinking that there must be a more fun way to get rid of my money.

The two moneybags pictured above only hold 1 yen and 5 yen coins. I estimate that the total value of all coins is not above 1000 yen (~10$). While I could simply deposit this into my bank account, I am also open to suggestions as to what to do with the money. I don't want to bring it with me because it's heavy, so I want to get rid of it before I leave. I thought about 'accidentally' dropping it in the middle of Hon Atsugi station, or giving it to a homeless guy. If you have any suggestion please let me know :)
