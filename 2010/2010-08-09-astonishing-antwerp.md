Astonishing Antwerp in Beautiful Belgium: the city of cleavage, daring and delightful!<p>
After arriving in Antwerp, as soon as I approached the hotel, I was amazed by the amount of beauty. A bazillion beautiful Belgian babes! Breathtaking buildings, baroque boulevards, truly a celebrity city.<p>
All alliteration aside though, I've traveled around a fair bit, but never before have I seen so many beautiful people together in one place. It did really surprise me. The city itself seems very nice, with a lot of traditional buildings, cobblestone roads etc. But the thing that surprised me most were the people. Well, I've only just arrived. More memorious messages later as myself makes many magnificent memories in this magnificent metropolis.<p>
