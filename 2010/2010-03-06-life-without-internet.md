Can you imagine it? I might be an extreme example, but I'm sure my life would be very empty if I didn't have internet. Even on the cycling trip I'm planning to have a mobile internet connection, and I guess I'll visit internet cafe's along the way when my battery dies out. I'm addicted.

The 'say farewell to everyone before you leave' has started for me, and today I visited some friends in Fujisawa. Their house was very nice, but one thing that I immediately noticed as I entered was that they had no PC anywhere! No internet at home, during the weekend or on weekdays. I guess it's not that necessary anymore, as in Japan even the cheapest mobile phone has fairly advanced internet functionality, and most people will have access to internet at work. Still, I would very much miss my internet connection in the weekends.

I dare you, no internet at home for a week. What will you do?
