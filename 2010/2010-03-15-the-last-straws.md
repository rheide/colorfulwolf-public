So, my last working week has started, and things are nowhere near where I want them to be. New things keep on popping up, both inside and outside of work, and things never happen exactly as I want them to. At work a lot of last-minute problems are suddenly popping up, and problems that never occurred before now need urgent solving. At work I'm keeping busy with transfering my knowledge on the projects that I was involved in by way of meetings, writing documentation and deploying fixed versions of tools. It's hectic until the end, and I guess that's not bad. During the past 1-2 weeks I've barely had time to think.

My room is a mess right now. There's boxes and garbage bags everywhere. I'm throwing out a lot of things but there's not a lot of progress. There's so much stuff that I don't really want to keep, but don't really want to throw away either. The stuff that I really care about only fills a very tiny cardboard box, and the meh stuff fills the other three big ones. And even then I'm throwing away/giving away/selling more than half of my earthly possessions.

My most prized possession is my hard disk. One might call me over-protective, but I like to take good care of my data. I've got two 1.5 terabyte drives set up in a mirrored RAID 1 external case, which I plan to send back home insured and by priority mail. On this (encrypted) hard disk are the originals of all the photos I took since I got my first digital camera. That's a lot of memories. If the hard disk somehow gets lost in transit then I have a backup on a different hard disk that I will keep here in Japan, and another backup on blu-ray discs. I also keep a copy of the last 3-6 months of pictures online, on a private fileshare.

I'm not sure how to feel about all of this. Like I said before, I haven't had much time to think, but sometimes I suddenly realize what I'm about to do, and I wonder what in life's name I am doing. At times I am so excited about the upcoming trip that I can't sleep, and at other times I am so worried about what I will do after the trip ends, and I also cannot sleep. The remainder of my nights I spend writing semi-coherent blogposts and cleaning my room.

It's still raining. It's been raining for weeks. I wonder when it will finally stop.
