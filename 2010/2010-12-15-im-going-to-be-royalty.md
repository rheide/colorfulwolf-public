It doesn't really surprise me that these spammers managed to find my e-mail address. I'm slightly miffed as to where they got my full name from, though. It may have been a dodgy job searching website where I posted my CV to earlier. My own fault, I guess. I find myself mildly entertained by this e-mail, yet at the same time want to deny those who are behind this their right to exist. Spammers and scammers are among the most evil things in this world.
