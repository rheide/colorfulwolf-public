I'm still at Capa Sata, enjoying the great weather and relaxing a bit. I walked from the camp site to the southernmost point today, which was quite a decent hike. It felt great to walk on a road that was nearly impossible to climb with my heavy bicycle, yet easily conquered by a weightless hiker. Every hour a single car passes. The scenery is beautiful and I am walking to the southernmost point of Kyushu. For the first time since I've been here I feel like it was worth it to come here.

(I'm still camping and my battery is running out again, so I will save the photos for next time. Sumimasen!)
