I cycled towards the mountains today, looking for new paths. The <a href="/blog/2010/02/07/unfit-for-duty/" target="_blank">last time</a> I did this the first random road I took turned out to be a dead end, with a very steep incline. This time luck was with me. I took many random roads, and they never turned out to be a dead end. Instead, I found some very nice scenery in places where I never went before. I expected the road to stop at every turn, but somehow there's quite an extensive road network in the mountain areas.

Tired now, so just photos.

For this mini-panorama, I didn't use my S90's panorama mode, instead I just took 3 photos. Program mode used different exposures for each photo. <a href="http://hugin.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Hugin </a>handles this just fine.
