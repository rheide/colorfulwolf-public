I'm staying in Holland longer than expected. Finding the job I want is not easy.

I took a long walk around the area tonight. Well, since this is the countryside, the only type of walk is a long walk, as everything is very far away.

The forest area around here is nice though.

Taking long walks is very refreshing. You should do it too.
