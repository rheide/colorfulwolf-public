I posted this picture before about a month ago, on the day that I took it. Right now I find myself wishing I was on a trip again, cycling to some new place. I've never been more happy than the time when I left everything behind and lived a simple life. Well, if you think that bringing an internet connection on a cycling trip as 'simple life' then the previous statement is true.

Gotta start cycling again before I get fat.
