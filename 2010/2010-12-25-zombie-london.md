This otherwise busy shopping street was completely empty this morning. I have never seen London so desolate and lifeless as it was today. Even the tube stations are closed, which was a bit of a surprise to me. I figured that in the city life always goes on as usual. Not so on Christmas day. Honestly, I think that's rather worthless. Mind you, the reason that I think it's worthless is because I am a messy person, and yesterday I had the choice between getting my newly bought PC home or going grocery shopping. I am typing this from my new PC.

Merry Christmas all! Let's look forward to the new year!
