I'm in northern Germany on a trip with my parents. I'm very meh about it. It doesn't really feel like we've really left Holland, as everything is the same, including our activities. Drive car, go to cafe, eat food, drive car, go to hotel, drink beer, eat food, go to sleep.

In the meantime I am amusing myself by drinking large beers while reading a book about cognitive science in English and at the same time trying to have a conversation with my parents in Dutch. Yay.
