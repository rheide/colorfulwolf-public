Who would have thought that I would be the last one to leave Atsugi? Certainly not me. Right from the very beginning I've always assumed that this was just a transitional period. I would only be here for a short time and then go somewhere else. The reason that things did not turn out this way is the same reason as why I am the last one to leave: it is entirely thanks to my friends that I've enjoyed a great life here, and I have always wanted to extend this period for as long as possible.  I thought a thank you would be in place after four great years. So thank you, my friends, for being here with me, and a very special warm place in my heart for my two closest friends, who were with me until the end, sharing so many similar experiences with me in Japan. It's been a great time, you guys. Now it's time to start over again somewhere else!

Thank you.
