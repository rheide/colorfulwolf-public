Right. So I got a new tent today. Since my room is nearly empty I figured I could try it in my room. It's very short! - only 2 meters, which makes it a very snug fit when sleeping. I'll have to diagonalize myself a bit to fit in nicely, I think. I'll be trying it out tonight. If it turns out to be too small I could go back to the store and get one size bigger, which is 210cm. Anyway, so far it feels robust! The tent poles build themselves magically/magnetically and they're made of metal altogether, which is a lot better than the cracking plastic of the old tent. Setting it up literally took less than 10 minutes ^_^
