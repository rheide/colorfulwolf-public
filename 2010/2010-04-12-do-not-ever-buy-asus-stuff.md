My netbook's power adapter just died, 12 hours before the trip. Damn it.

Update (1 hour later): the adapter miraculously started working again. My temper went down a bit, so I nuanced the previous remark a bit o_0

Not sure what to do now. Do I delay the trip and get a new adapter tomorrow, or do I risk it and just go? If it breaks on the way then I'll probably have to wait until Kyoto/Osaka until I get another chance to buy a new adapter. Hmm...
