Yeah, didn't have any :P

Seriously though, I think it's fascinating that people can experience so many things, and change their minds about things so much, but some core values are never changed. We never forgot what's important.

Quote out of a book somewhere obtained via Brian (freely adapted):
<blockquote>I regret not doing two things when I was young: take more risks, and reflect on my life more.</blockquote>
(This fascination is part of the reason why I'm interested in CogSci).

I still remember, and I'm still the same core person inside. Enjoy life.
