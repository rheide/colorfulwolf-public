Here's some more photos of my <a href="/blog/travel/spirit-of-japan/" target="_blank">cycling trip</a> in Japan. This time I'm sharing some photos that I took on the <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.025348,136.647949&amp;spn=3.245738,4.938354&amp;z=8" target="_blank">Kii peninsula</a>, from Mie, Wakayama and Nara prefectures.

After taking the ferry to Kii, I cycled along a big road when I suddenly spotted a youth hostel sign. I followed it onto this road and eventually had to climb a huge hill to finally reach the hostel.

I really miss the mountains. (but not the JUSCO)

This was quite a tough climb, but not too tough. It was also one of the most beautiful roads I've found.

Doing laundry at a business hotel. I had to leave again the next morning. My laundry was not dry.

Spotting a vending machine after a long period of cycling is like approaching the finish line after finishing a hillclimb.

Awkward raindrops on a poster of a politician. &gt;_&lt;;

Still more to come!
