San Francisco left a very good (and hopefully lasting) impression on me. This is the view of San Francisco after crossing the Golden Gate bridge.

Aforementioned bridge. Who would not recognize this sight?

A random street in SanFran. I'm still amazed at how much it looks like GTA San Andreas.

It was a bit busy in SF, but honestly the driving experience has been brilliant. Everything's huge. Wide roads, big parking spaces, there's always enough room for everybody, even in the city. And the mountain roads are just excellent. Driving is fun in California.

A bit south of San Francisco, looking towards the bay.

California was great. I'd love to visit there again.

(I'm sure I will :) )
