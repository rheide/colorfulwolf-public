I've lived near this lake (called the Zuidlaardermeer) for my whole life, until I went to Japan. I used to have a tiny motorboat when I was around twelve years old. I explored the whole lake with it, and had a lot of fun.

When I had the little motorboat we used to live farther from the lake, and we'd come here in weekends and on holidays. These days we live right next to the lake. My boat was sold many years ago. My sister has a boat now. She also explored the lake with it.

These photos were made last week. It was the first time in a couple of years that I've been on the lake. I never go there anymore. It's actually a rather boring place after you've grown up. Still, my fondest childhood memories happened around this lake. It's a very nostalgic place for me.
