Last week I went to England with a couple of friends to do some photography. Our trip took us up north towards the border of Scotland, where we stayed for several days. The main goal was <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Seahouses,+United+Kingdom&amp;sll=53.1478,6.723633&amp;sspn=0.146813,0.308647&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Seahouses,+United+Kingdom&amp;ll=55.61634,-1.64782&amp;spn=0.01728,0.054932&amp;t=h&amp;z=15" target="_blank">Farnes island</a>, which is a group of islands just off the coast ruled by birds. It's a bit hidden on Google Maps, as when you zoom out it just doesn't appear at all.

I have to admit that I didn't really have my mind set on photography before the trip, and with little previous experience (or interest, TBH) in bird photography I wasn't sure what to expect. As it turns out I got back into the habit real quick and was soon snapping away at random things again, all the time wishing I had a better lens. If I only I had money to spare for an f/2.8 zoom... Nonetheless, I had an excellent time :D

Good weather seemed to follow us around, although it was a lot colder than I expected. Still, blue skies and interesting cloud formations kept appearing, so all in all I'm quite satisfied. Besides bird watching we also went around the area's towns, and skipped across the border to Scotland to visit Edinburgh, which was a really amazing city. We took a day off to visit Northumberland National Park but didn't see a lot of wildlife. We did drive a 'forest trail' through the area which was supposed to be a rough path but was really just a regular road. I did have a bit of fun that day on the back, driving through narrow, winding, hilly roads in pitch black darkness, rabbits appearing out of nowhere all the time. It felt a bit like driving a rally stage (well, on asphalt).

I have a lot of photos to sort through, and I'll post some more later, after I'm back from Germany, which is next week's destination. No rest for the wicked.. For now, here's a <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/rv7021/2010UKTrip#" target="_blank">selection of photos</a> on Picasa. Hope you like them :)
