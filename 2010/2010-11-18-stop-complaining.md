Depressed people annoy me.

Maybe it's the season, maybe it's an alien psychodepressionbeam directed towards the earth, but lately I've been confronted with a lot of depressed people. Normally I try to console them and take the soft approach to cheering people up, but I just don't feel up for it. STOP BEING DEPRESSED, YOU ASSHOLES!!!! Life is long, we're all in it together, so start being happy for fuck's sake. You're not making the world a better place by being depressed, so get over it. Your problems may seem very important to you, but they're not, really. We all have to deal with crap on a daily basis, you are not special. So suck it up and get on with your life.

Or, if I was less of a troll, I'd tell you to look at the issue of depression from a rational point of view. You're not making your life any better by feeling sad about it. Because you're feeling depressed, you'll miss chances, fail to see opportunities and generally put yourself more in a slump than you already were. It leads nowhere. Apparently, pretending to be happy/optimistic helps (although I can't find the source article for that right now). Other people will act differently towards you if you seem happy, and more good things will happen to you. It matters whether you're introvert or extrovert, according to <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/node/46944" target="_blank">this article</a>. Introverts are less actively seeking happiness and can entertain themselves for a longer period if their social life collapses. Extroverts might feel depressed if they don't have a social clique where they feel comfortable. On the other hand, the larger amount of introspection in introverts means that introverts get depressed more easily.

I think the trick is to just feel happy. Haha. Some people say "dont' have expectations, cause you'll feel unhappy if you can't live up to them". I say: have expectations, but be happy even if you don't manage to live up to them. Just live life.

A strategy that the <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/16/sitting-quietly-doing-something/" target="_blank">happiest man in the world</a> will surely agree with.
