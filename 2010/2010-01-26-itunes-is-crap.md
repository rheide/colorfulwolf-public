I've said it before, and I will say it once more: iTunes is shit! I don't want to sync my iPod to my PC. iTunes supports that, and it lets me create playlists on the iPod just fine, but then it won't let me create playlist folders. It does let me move my existing playlist folders, but then it doesn't let me move them back to where they were. This post may seem calm, but I am really quite pissed off. This is what happens if you're at the shit-end of a popular company. If you want to do things any way that's different from theirs, then you're screwed.
