The poll I added a couple of weeks ago did not prove very popular: I got a total of 8 votes -___-. So that won't really affect my choice in genre for future articles. I'll continue like before, with one notable change: 2010 will have an exciting long-lasting storyline! What that storyline will be is something I will hopefully be able to reveal next week, or next next week.

Until then, let me amuse you with some infornography:
<ul>
	<li>Average number of views per day: between 30 and 60</li>
	<li>Most popular article by far: <a href="/blog/2008/07/06/aokigahara-the-twisted-forest/" target="_blank">Aokigahara, the suicide forest</a>. This generates about three times as much traffic every day than all other pages (including the front page) combined.</li>
	<li>This blog was imported from my old blog <a href="/blog/" target="_blank">Wakaremichi</a> at the end of 2007.</li>
	<li>Since starting Wakaremichi (then called ZooiEnzo, which is Dutch for StuffAndThings) I have published 797 blogposts, and I've written at least 30 drafts that I was too embarrassed about to publish.</li>
</ul>
I started blogging because I was about to start living in Japan. Should I stop blogging when I leave? Or maybe when I'm 'integrated'? I do like the idea of a global theme throughout a blog, which was the main reason why I moved from Wakaremichi to The colorful wolf; it was the signal that I was getting used to life in Japan, and from that point on the variety of topics increased to also include stuff not directly related to Japan. Maybe during the span of this year a redesign would be appropriate.
