Five months ago I was <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&amp;ll=30.996372,130.662181&amp;spn=0.012783,0.020256&amp;t=h&amp;z=16" target="_blank">here</a>. I threw away most of my worldly possessions, sent my remaining stuff home to my parents and cycled 2000 kilometers from Tokyo until the southernmost tip of Japan, carrying with me nothing but the bare necessities. Four side bags of survival items and a backpack of electronics. No time limit, no pre-set course to take. I have never before in my life felt so free, and I'm not sure if I will ever feel that free again. I really miss that time right now.

Of course I realize that most of that freedom is just an illusion. For one thing, it's pretty much impossible to get away from civilization in Japan. A second limitation was money and my visa status, which limited the duration of my trip, although I finished it long before either one became endangered.

Leaving everything behind and going on a bare-necessities trip with no time limit. I'm not sure if I will ever be in a similar opportunity again, but to those of you who will: don't hesitate! It will be the best experience of your life!
