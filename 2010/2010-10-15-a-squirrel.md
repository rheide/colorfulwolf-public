Saw this funny little creature near Staines, on the way to the train station. There were a lot of them, but this little guy just sat there looking at me. We had a bit of a Mexican stand-off, with me trying to reach for my camera and snap a photo before he disappeared. He was sitting right in front of me but I wasn't fast enough and he climbed higher up in the tree.
