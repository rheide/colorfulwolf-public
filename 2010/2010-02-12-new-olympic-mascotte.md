<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/7187027/Polish-newspaper-claims-Pedobear-is-2010-Vancouver-Olympic-mascot.html" target="_blank">This</a> is what happens when newspaper don't properly confirm their source before publishing. A Polish newspaper published an article about the 2010 Olympics in Vancouver with a photo of the official mascottes, plus one not-so-official mascotte. Seems that someone created an image that includes the <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/pedobear" target="_blank">Pedobear</a>, and the newspaper, for some mysterious (or probably stupid) reason decided to use that picture without checking if it was correct or not. Brilliantly it was only a couple of days later that a <a href="http://www.geenstijl.nl/mt/archieven/2010/02/ook_avro_in_de_fout_met_pedobe.html" target="_blank">Dutch magazine</a> made the same mistake..
