How am I supposed to remember exactly what I put in those boxes two months ago?!?! Besides, the field on the form is too small to write everything down anyway.. so don`t tell me to be specific! And why must the value of each item be larger than zero yen? And why must it be the price of the item when I bought it? What if it was a gift and you don`t know the value? And finally, why does the annoying post office lady keep on pressuring me to send by EMS which is way more expensive? I already told her that I won`t go back for at least 3 weeks, so what`s the point of my stuff arriving home in 1 week?!

Argh! Screw you, `civilization`! I`m going back to my tent.
