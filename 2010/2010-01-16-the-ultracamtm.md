It's a Logitech ultra crappy webcam with a Canon G7 extension tube + Raynox ultra wide angle converter (0.5x). Result: I can now show my whole room on the webcam instead of just one corner :D

Also, shame on Logitech for being rather shitty about their Win7 drivers. After I finally found Win7 x64 drivers for 'Logitech webcams', it still wouldn't install. It took me some investigating until I finally found a small message on Logitech's website saying that 'legacy webcams are not supported on Windows 7'. Despite that, I force installed the drivers by simply selecting a different model webcam that was actually supported, and it worked. Moral of the story: never believe what other people say, always find out for yourself!
