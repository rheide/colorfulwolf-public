This photo was taken almost 3 years ago in Kyushu, Japan. Our first day ever on a cycling trip, and the first day 'in the wild' of Japan. To make a long story short, we ended up pitching our tents on top of a hill in front of some hotel rooms, with the owner's permission. What a great view to wake up to.

So why the sudden reminiscence? Well, I did in fact gather up enough courage to go running today, and my mind was warped. It's as if I had been thinking at 10% capacity for the past few weeks, and now I've suddenly found my wits back. I remembered stuff that I had long forgotten, and I thought up some nice solutions for the website project that I've been working on. Let that be a lesson to all of us techies: exercise builds inspiration!
