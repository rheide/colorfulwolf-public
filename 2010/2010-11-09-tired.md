I am very tired today. I think I am finally done thinking for a while. During the past few weeks I have been studying a lot, preparing for all kinds of job interviews. Phone interviews, on-site interviews, paper tests, tech questions, brainbreaker questions, algorithm questions, a lot of things were thrown at me. Finally I am released from trying to give people a good impression of myself and everything I know in only 45 minutes.

So where am I going? Indeed. I am going to answer that question at the end of this month, when the answer will be finally final. In the meantime I'll be preparing to start my new life!

(And relax a bit)
