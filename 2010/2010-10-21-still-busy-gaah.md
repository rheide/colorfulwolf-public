I'm studying up on all things algorithmy to prepare for my next interview. It's amazing how many important things I've forgotten since university, and it's even more amazing how many important CS topics weren't even taught or not properly emphasized during my education. Fortunately we have the internets to help solve that deficiency.

Also, here's another Dartmoor photo.
