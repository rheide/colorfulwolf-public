Went to Dartmoor national park and nearby Plymouth last week. Today I finally spent some time to upload the remaining photos. Picasa holds all my <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/mrhazard/Dartmoor" target="_blank">Dartmoor pics</a>.

I've been annoyed at my attempts at producing decent HDR images recently. Either my valuation of HDR changed, or I am producing photos that are simply not suited for HDR. The above photo is in fact HDR, but the colors were so messed up that I decided to sepialize it instead, which fit the grainy nature of the original. The full size image is a bit abysmal though. Here's another gritty one.

And here's two panoramas of Plymouth, a very agreeable city.

Nice park. Quite cold though.

I like the UK. It has more character than the Netherlands. I think it's the hills.
