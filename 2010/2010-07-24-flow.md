Busy days lately. We're driving around the northern part of England going to various places to take photos. Today we traveled across some roads that I can only describe as rally courses. It was very fun to drive, but the weather wasn't very good. All in all it had a very northernly atmosphere. Very highlandic. Anyway, more later. I'm tired now and really should sleep. Driving back to London tomorrow :S
