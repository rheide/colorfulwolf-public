I've been playing with new Holux GPS logger a bit, so I thought I'd share my first impressions. First of all, the device itself is way better than the Gisteq thingie I used to have. The Holux (m-241c) has a nice screen that displays from which satellite it's receiving the signal, the current coordinates, speed and distance. It's excellent. A bit less excellent is the software, which looks and behaves like a 12-year old designed it. The software always uses 100% CPU usage while downloading the data, which takes an unusually long amount of time, considering it's only a couple of kilobytes per log file. Thankfully the utility can export to all the major formats (Google Earth's kml, and the very useful GPX format), which is great.

All in all I'm quite happy with it, although I can't form an opinion on the battery life yet. Anyway, <a href="http://www.everytrail.com/view_trip.php?trip_id=529454" target="_blank">here's</a> the trip I made to Yokohama today, beautifully visualized by EveryTrail. I'll have to figure out how to embed that into my blog somehow.. Wordpress.com doesn't allow the embed tag, so perhaps my only option would be to install wordpress myself on colorfulwolf.com. There's a 95% chance that I'm too lazy to do that, though.. :D
