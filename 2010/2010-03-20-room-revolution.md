The things that made my room 'my room' are mostly gone now. I sold my bed, desk and microwave today. Most of my personal belongings I already put in boxes. Tired now. There's a huge wind blowing outside that's loudly shaking every part of the building I live in. Strangely enough there's no rain and not many clouds at all. I'm wondering if I could succesfully spend the night in a tent if the wind is this strong..

Still not feeling very good about the whole thing. I guess that will only change when I finally depart. That might actually turn out to be sooner than expected. Although it's storming right now it's quite warm (~20C), and room preparations are proceeding smoothly as well. Plus, spending my days in this boring empty room would be terrible, so I'd better leave quickly.
