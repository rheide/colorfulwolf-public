Finally! <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/jipdnfibhldikgcjhfnomkfpcebammhp" target="_blank">Get Rikaichan for Chrome here</a>.

Rikaichan is an awesome browser extension that shows you the meaning and pronunciation of the Japanese kanji as you hover your mouse over it. It's been available for Firefox for a very long time, and now it's finally here for Chrome. This is a must-have for people who want to read Japanese but suck at kanji!

(And speaking of brilliant programs, if you always have a lot of windows open you might want to try <a href="http://www.winsplit-revolution.com/" target="_blank">WinSplit Revolution</a>, it's extremely useful!)
