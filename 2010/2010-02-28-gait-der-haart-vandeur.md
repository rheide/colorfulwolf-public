Cycled to the beach today. Did not realize there was a tsunami expected until after I saw the fire trucks. Don't know what they were doing though. There were lots of people on the beach walking their dog or just looking out in general, maybe waiting for the tsunami. I left before anything happened though.

I'm trying out the circular polarizer filter that I bought a couple of weeks ago, but so far I can hardly see any difference, even when the conditions for using a CP are supposedly very good. I think Â I need to play with it a bit more..

(Yes, I know I'm supposed to rotate the filter to get the best effect... -__-)
