I was going to make this a grand photo post with lots of photos from Antwerp. Unfortunately the internet connection at the hotel is so slow that I couldn't even upload one. Instead I present you with words.

So, I've met up with Brian, and we're doing a little software development project together. What it is exactly I don't want to tell you yet, as you'll find out soon enough. In any case, we're hanging around in Antwerp, walking through the city, sitting at cafes trying to get the creative spirit out. It's an interesting proof of concept for both of us. We're getting experience in programming, but more importantly we are going through the entire process of development, from idea to end product, which is very interesting. We've only just started though, so who knows what the end result will be.

Being away from home has become the standard for me for the past months: I've spent more time away from home than at home. It's been a while since I felt this free, and I must say that I like it very much. Catching up on old times, discussing about the future, I'm gaining a new perspective on life. Or rather, I'm regaining an old one that I dearly missed.

Every time I board a plane home, whether my home is Japan or the Netherlands, I always think about my life and my goals when I'm on the plane. By the time I've arrived on the ground I will have made big plans for my life, great things to accomplish and important things to change about my lifestyle. By the time I'm back in the safety of my own room those plans are quickly forgotten and I return to my old dastardly ways.

Sometimes I last longer. I might manage for a week or so to keep one of my resolutions, like going cycling every day, eating less snacks, or applying for jobs, but eventually that momentum starts to disappear and I find back my natural state of continuous procrastination. The cycling thing has finally become a regular activity for me, but it took my resignation and a two-month cycling trip to accomplish the regularity with which I now get on my bicycle. It's not easy to change. But that doesn't mean we should stop trying.
