A mother teaching her child how to ride a bicycle in a park in Nagasaki.

A young boy giving me one of his candy on Fukushima island.

Another young boy laughing as we both move left and right three times in a row trying to avoid bumping into each other as we pass each other on the street.

A little girl enjoys her first talk to a foreigner and makes sure the whole restaurant knows it, making everyone laugh.

For the first time in my life I am thinking: having children is not so bad.
