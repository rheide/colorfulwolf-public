Yes, it is what you think it is. People who dress up as superheroes in real life. With a twist, because these people actually try to make a difference. But they dress up in costumes. But they're doing good for society. But they look ridiculous. But they can save humanity. But not without getting funny looks.

I can't decide! Is this awesome or ridiculous?
