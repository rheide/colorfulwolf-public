Take a listen at how different people play the third movement of Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata in different ways.

I'd want to comment on how these people play, but I really can't. I don't know enough about classical music yet. Somehow the fourth video appeals to me the most, although I can't quite put into words why. The third video is also incredible.

(I added a music category to my blog especially for this post)
