That's right, it's a Japanese drama show set in the AXT Tower! The cool helicopter shot of the tower was made a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday morning, which I remember clearly because that was the day I had to walk back to the tower to pick up my bicycle, as the front fender broke and made it unmovable. As I was ripping off my front fender at the back of the tower people at the front were shooting this drama show. Awesome :D
