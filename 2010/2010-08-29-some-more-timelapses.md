Here's some more time lapse videos, one from Antwerp, one from Amsterdam and one from my home town of Hometown. I'm not happy with any of them, but I didn't expect to be, as I didn't really devote any serious effort into setting up the camera. The perfect example of this is the overexposed beach video. My Canon S90's damn annoying rear dial decided to move from auto ISO to ISO 3200. Whoever designed the S90 seriously fucked this up. The dial is very quick to switch from auto ISO (the lowest option) to ISO 3200 (the highest option), but the opposite never seems to happen. I only found out when I got back home that the time lapse was ruined. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09vVF-Hvykg" target="_blank">What a shame</a>.
