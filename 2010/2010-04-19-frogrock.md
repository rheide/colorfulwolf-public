After getting off the ferry I initially went the wrong way. Can't go south cause I'll get stuck on a peninsula. Have to go north now, to Ise. Before going north I had an awesome lunch at a sushi place near the harbor. Every plate was 105 yen! And it was good stuff too. Not excellent, but good. I quite enjoyed myself.

Going north I soon reached Futami, suddenly spotted a sign that said 'youth hostel' and followed it until I reached a mountain. After a nasty walk up the hill I found that the youth hostel is located next to a temple, which is a pretty awesome place for a youth hostel. Since it was cheap too (only 2500 yen) I decided to stay there for tonight and take it easy. There might be rain tonight, and tomorrow will be a tough day. Besides that, I saw my face again for the first time in 2 days, and I'm completely red, despite the sunscreen. Any more sun and I'll explode.

I wanted to do laundry around here, but alas, no coin laundry in sight, and people tell me it doesn't exist. So instead I went tourist-mode and went to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meoto_Iwa" target="_blank">frogrock</a>, which is about 500m from the hostel. It's supposedly quite a famous site. This <a href="http://www.seekjapan.jp/article-1/917/A+Day+Tripper's+Guide+to+Ise+and+Toba" target="_blank">website </a>has some more info about it. All I saw was a rock that looked like a frog, and a bunch of old Japanese people who walked funny. Tourism sucks. Definitely not going to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ise_Grand_Shrine" target="_blank">Ise jingu</a>. There is zero value in doing things that are already documented online. After all, there's no physical effort involved in watching, so what's the point?

I just checked the weather report again, and it definitely looks like rain. Great... Well, at least I won't get as much sunburn then. Tomorrow is a rough day: I'm following the route 42 all the way down deep into Mie-ken. I'm not sure if I can reach the 'bottom', but I'll give it a try. Depending on the weather and the road I might just follow the main road all the time, getting some momentum going so I can reach Kyoto quickly. I could use a break, and I could definitely use some clean clothes.
