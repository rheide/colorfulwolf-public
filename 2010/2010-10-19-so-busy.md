Haven't updated recently, although there's a lot of stuff going on right now in my life. Had a very agreeable trip to Dartmoor national park over the weekend, and today I had another job interview, the most challenging yet. I still have a bunch of pictures to sort out and a whole lot of things to prepare for my return to Holland tomorrow. Feels good to be busy again.

More later!
