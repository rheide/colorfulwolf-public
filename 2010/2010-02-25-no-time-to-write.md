Been busy with work lately, attending many meeting and preparing many documents related to transferring my work to the next person. Ironically this is making me enjoy my work more and makes me a bit sad to leave it all behind. It's the stuff I've been working on for four years, after all. No more programming for me for quite some time! I wonder if I can survive...

It's almost March already! Still a lot of stuff left to do..
