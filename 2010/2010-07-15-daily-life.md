Stupid things I've done since being back from Japan:
<ul>
	<li>At a crossing with my bicycle, crossing the road, then realizing that I'm driving on the left side.</li>
	<li>At the supermarket, waiting at the conveyor belt and wondering why they don't give me a plastic bag.</li>
	<li>At night getting hungry, thinking "I'll just go to conbini and pick up some food", then realizing that I'm in Holland.</li>
	<li>Almost (many times): after paying at a store, getting a sudden urge to say "Doumo" or "Arigato".</li>
	<li>Almost: meeting a person I haven't seen in a while and greeting them with "hisashiburi".</li>
	<li>Expecting to find public toilets during a long cycling trip.</li>
	<li>Ordering a book at Amazon.com and expecting it to arrive within a week.</li>
	<li>Expecting good customer service (see previous post)</li>
</ul>
Besides the 'incidents' mentioned above it's been life as usual. I'm still frustrated that my quest for knowledge is not proceeding as fast as I'd like. The longer I have to wait, the more I think about worst-case scenarios, which is not helping my mood. But as long as I'm making a little progress every day I don't feel too bad.

Here's some photos I made at my desk with the S90. Sepia coloring at ISO 3200.
