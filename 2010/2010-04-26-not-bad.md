The weather is good, the roads are flat, and I'm almost at my destination already! The youth hostel I booked is about 25km's further ahead, so it shouldn't take me that long to reach it. Right now I'm at a cafe on the top of a hill having lunch. A 32-year old good-looking waitress was so impressed with my Japanese that she proposed to me. Yeah, things are going alright.
