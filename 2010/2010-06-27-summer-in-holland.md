The cows you usually see in Holland are always white with black spots (or black with white spots, whatever you prefer), but these cows are a bit different. They're not used for farming. They live in a small natural area close to our house. This 'natural' area is being preserved and left alone to let nature run its course.

Good things about cycling in Holland:
<ul>
	<li>It's very flat. There are no hills.</li>
	<li>The roads are long and straight and easy to cycle on.</li>
	<li>The nature is very pretty.</li>
	<li>There's many roads that lead to the same place, so I can take a different one each time. (Unlike Japan, which usually only has space for one road)</li>
</ul>

	<li>The roads are long and straight and very boring.</li>
	<li>The nature is very pretty, but I grew up here and have seen the same sights a million times already.</li>
	<li>There's many roads that lead to the same place. Unfortunately they all look the same, and it doesn't matter which one I take.</li>
</ul>
Oh well, at least I got some exercise.

(Go Japan! Hope you can kick some Paraguay ass tonight!)
