Hello people. It's 2008. I'm still in Japan. Is that good or bad? Do I regret my choice? Should I look for something different? Should I stay here and be happy where I am? These are some of the choices that are not important to me at all.

Yup, that's a crappy intro for a massive subject. I'm not really thinking about making the right or the wrong choices, rather I'm thinking about whether or not I should regret the bad choices I made. I think I should, but I am finding more and more that each bad choice that I made has a huge amount of consequences, and some of those consequences, good or bad, have made me the person I am today. A bitter and cynical old bastard. Oh wait, I think that was Marco (the old one) o_0. I hope I'm not following into his footsteps... Nope. I'm still happy with who I am, and I know that in the end I will be a better person for it. A lot of past regrets are gone because of this. Now I find myself regretting that I could not have been a better influence on some of the people I have met...
