It's a three-day weekend, so I had one more day to do some cycling. The weather's been excellent lately. A perfect temperature for cycling, and a clear blue sky. So I went out today and went to an area that I hadn't been to before: Hadano. I didn't quite reach it but I did find some very beautiful scenes. Most of the pictures I made were done with the Canon IXY compact camera because I was too lazy to use the DSLR. Later on I did take it out and take some pictures though. I leave it as a challenge to the reader to figure out which pictures were done with the compact camera and which ones came from the DSLR (no EXIF info peeking!). <a href="http://picasaweb.google.co.jp/mrhazard/TheLastOne" target="_blank">Here are the pictures.</a>

And here's a couple of panoramas:
