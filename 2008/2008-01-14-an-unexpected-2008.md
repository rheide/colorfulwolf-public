It still exists. My lifestyle here. My life is like having a party on Friday night with friends and sleeping the whole Saturday and then watching a movie with people from all over the world. My life is like going on a crazy trip with people and having a lot of fun. But most of all, my life is like returning from a trip during the last hours of the weekend, going to the conbini at midnight to pick up some food, and receiving an email on my phone from someone telling me that the trip was really great, and that it's going to be a GREAT 2008. How can I possibly argue with that?
