Lately I am incredibly bored. I don't want to do anything. I know what I want to do, but for various reasons I cannot do the things I want. Everything else seems boring. So I am BORED. At least there's the European football cup to watch. At 4AM. Yay.

This Sunday I'm going with a lot of people to Tokyo, where there will be a time freeze event. Several hundred people will go to a busy train station, and at a certain time, just freeze. Stop what they're doing. Standing still. No movement at all. This will obviously freak out all the Japanese people and create hilarious situations, so we'll be there to participate. Seems like a good chance to take pictures. And relieve my boredom.

Pap! Mam! dankjewel! Ik ga ervan genieten :D
