I know I shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth, but this printer is really retarded. After printing until half of the page it spools about 3 or 4 pages and then continues printing on another page. That is, if it makes it halfway, because usually there's a communications failure before that. The scanner is no different and usually fails before the complete document can be scanned. It's hopeless and really not worth debugging. I should just get a new one.. Printers are cheap anyway these days...

RIP Alvaro's printer! I tried to save you but I failed...
