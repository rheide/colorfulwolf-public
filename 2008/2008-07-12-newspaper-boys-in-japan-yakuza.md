Just now another guy rang my doorbell and tried to sell me a newspaper subscription. This time he looked really dodgy. It makes me wonder if the whole newspaper story is perhaps just a cover for some yakuza (Japanese organized crime syndicates), looking to offer more than just newspapers... Would be exciting if it was true... Anyhow, I didn't like the look of this guy at all, and he kept on trying to look in my room while he was talking to me. Highly suspiscious. I should get a baseball bat or something. I might get robbed soon.
