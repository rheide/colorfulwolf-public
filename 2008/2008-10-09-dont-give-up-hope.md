Hello, you-who-are-close-to-me-and-had-something-bad-happen-to-you-recently,

how are you? You are probably wondering if I wrote this blogpost especially for you. That's not true. In the past few weeks bad things happened to almost all of my close friends as well as to myself, and everybody is very down lately. We're all doing our own thing, only thinking negative thoughts. It's a negative spiral. Spending less time with friends makes you more depressed, and when you're more depressed you want to spend less time with your friends. 

Life goes on. That's the most important thing. Later you will probably regret how you treated other people in this period of your life, but you won't be able to change it later. Don't let old friendships die out, that would be such a waste. 

Try to motivate yourself. Friends are important, but you live your life for yourself. Your friends won't always be there for you. Don't let that blind you when making those hard decisions in life. The only person you can really trust is yourself. There. Spoken as a true cynic.. It doesn't mean you can't trust others, though. You just need to know when to trust them. Eventually someone will come along who you can really trust. And when that does happen, let me know, because I'll only believe it when I see it.

I have to stop here. I tried to write this while thinking about very specific people, and as a result the message is not really for any of them in specific. Each person should feel connected to a part of what I wrote, though. Everyone has their own personal problems. Take care, my closest friends, and perhaps, 10 years later, we will be able to look back on this period of our lives together, and laugh, and tell each other about the bad time we had, and how it all turned out ok in the end.  

I'm fine now. I'm thinking about my future. I know that I have to think about it alone, and that's what you should do too. Take care, and ask for help if you need it. That's what friends are for. 

Trust yourself.

Improve yourself.

Never give up.
