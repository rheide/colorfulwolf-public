I'd like to direct your attention to the <a href="http://www.jma.go.jp/en/amedas/000.html?elementCode=2" target="_blank">Japan Meteorological Agency</a>. Their website is the best source of information about anything weather-related to Japan. They provide information about tys, earthquakes, temperature, rain, etc. It's a very useful source for me when I plan my travels.

Here's their report on the earthquake. This came online only minutes after the actual earthquake! The earthquake was weird. It lasted for several minutes and everything was shaking around rhythmically, not in the usual sudden shocks of other earthquakes.

Here's the temperature for today: fucking hot. And this chart doesn't show the horrifying humidity.
