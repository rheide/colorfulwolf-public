Let me offer you one piece of advice: Do NOT take advice from other people! No other person can ever know your situation as well as you know it yourself. Perhaps they can offer some other point of view or a different perspective, but in the end, you need to take that information and absorb into yourself, so you can decide for yourself which way is best. Do not rely on people to choose for you. Learn from them and incorporate their knowledge into yourself. And then decide for yourself. Be it ulterior motives or lack of familiarity, no one can give you a perfectly clear answer. Trust yourself.
