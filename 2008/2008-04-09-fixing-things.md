<p style="text-align:left;">It's 3:14AM and I am re-installing Windows XP on my PC once more after a broken installation. Why it broke this time I really don't know, but all I can do is fix it. After a long problem-finding session I think we managed to narrow the list of suspects to the parallel ATA bus or the DVD drive, while the power supply and motherboard remain possible but unlikely suspects. It's not just the PC that's breaking, though.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">It doesn't matter. Finally, I am fixing things again. Things have been breaking for the past few months, and I'm finally taking steps to fix things. I'm trying to get everything back into working state. Cameras will get fixed. The PC I am fixing myself. Oh yes, and my life could use an overhaul too. Big things are coming. And even if they're not, I will make them happen. Time to disable the autopilot and get back control.</p>
