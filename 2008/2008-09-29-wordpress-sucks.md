With all respect, but blogger was better. I shouldn't have switched. Well, I'm here now, I won't bother switching back. It'll be better in the future. Where did the picture buttons go!?!? WTF...

So, I met up with Liou and Jose last week, who I hadn't seen in quite a while. Together with Alvaro and NN we had a quintuple reunion of people I knew from my first year in Japan. I'm quite happy I stayed.
