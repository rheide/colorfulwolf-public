What was going to be a simple hiking trip turned out to be one of the craziest trips I've ever made. In the end our feet hurt like hell from walking over 15 kilometres, part of it in the middle of the night and during dense fog... I'll make a travel report soon, but right now I'm very tired...

Update: <a href="/blog/travel/the-sea-of-trees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here is the travel report</a>, includes more photos. Also, here's a good book about Aokigahara.
