Ok, I chickened out today! I was planning to take a train to Fuji and then cycle back through the mountains to Atsugi, but at 7AM my willpower gave up and I slept till 11... Â Oh well. In the afternoon I went to the beach, and played with the 50D. Autofocus is so much better than the 400D! It's great fun to play with, and I shot some photo's of the surfer dudes, who were enjoying the waves. The wind was quite strong today. As usual, <a href="http://picasaweb.google.co.jp/mrhazard/TheBeach" target="_blank">the pictures are on Picasa</a>, and maybe I'll post some on my photoblog later :)

This is a picture of two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinkansen" target="_blank">Shinkansens</a> passing each other. The sun is reflecting quite strongly off the windows.
