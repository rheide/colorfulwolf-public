Take a look <a href="http://www.onexposure.net/" target="_blank">here</a>. It's a website containing only the best works of the best photographers/artists there are. Each picture is screened before it's placed on the site. It's a very elite group, and as a result of it the quality is unbelievable. Although the genre of images on the website is a bit specific, each and every one of the photo's is amazing. For example, take a look at <a href="http://www.onexposure.net/?photos=member&amp;memberid=2744&amp;photo=6865" target="_blank">this one</a>. Really cool stuff. I still have a long way to go before I can match that...
