I am going through life as if I were asleep. Everything I experience cannot get through to my brain. Instead there is a huge wall between my brain and all outside life. There is even a wall between my brain and myself. Nothing seems to be able to break it. Stress at work doesn't break it. Tiring myself out on my bicycle doesn't seem to break it. Getting lost at night and ending up in farmland doesn't seem to break it. I know why I feel this way, and I know how to fix it. But I willingly choose to feel this way. This is my choice. I will wait.

Here are some pictures I made while trying to relieve my boredom last night. They are not very good, but I thought I'd share them anyway. The cycling was actually fun, in a rather unconnected kind of way.
