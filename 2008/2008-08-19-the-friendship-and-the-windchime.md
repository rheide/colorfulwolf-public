Internet is terribly slow here (or is it WordPress? never had problems at Blogger!), and it's this time of the year again, so I'm not feeling too happy. The last two weeks have been really crazy, and I still find new things that I have never done in my life (like swimming near-naked in a river at night with all my colleagues :D), but somehow they don't manage to top the best experiences I've had two years ago. I have definitely become more cynical this year.
