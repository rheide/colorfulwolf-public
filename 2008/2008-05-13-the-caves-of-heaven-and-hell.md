Ladies and gentlemen, travel with me. I will take you to the creepiest place Japan has to offer: <a href="/blog/travel/the-caves-of-heaven-and-hell/" target="_self">the caves of heaven and hell</a>!

As part of the Shikoku trip a couple of weeks ago we visited a very interesting place in the middle of Shikoku, and I tried to make an equally eerie report of it. I updated the travel page with the link too, so check it out. Hope you like it :)
