I took a day off work today and went to Chinatown in Yokohama to celebrate the new year with the Chinese people. Today my camera passed the 9999 pictures mark and reset back to zero for the second time. In other words: I have now made over 20.000 pictures with my camera! More later but I really need to go to bed now. Oh, and my bike got stolen by the police today so I have to get it back from the compounded bicycles place tomorrow -___-
