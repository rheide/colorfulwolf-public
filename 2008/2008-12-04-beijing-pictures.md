Finally took the time to sub-sub-sub-select from all the pictures I want to save. It's quite ironic. I still suck as a photographer but I have a lot of trouble throwing away bad pictures. Perhaps that's what makes good photographers good. They throw away their crap. I just keep it :D

Anyway, <a href="http://picasaweb.google.co.jp/mrhazard/BestOfBeijing2008?pli=1#" target="_blank">here's</a> the pictures. Enjoy :)
