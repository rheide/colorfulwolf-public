No, the weather is not that good right now. The above movie was made a couple of months ago, but I found it today on my laptop. I guess I just forgot to process the pictures after making the time lapse. I found it while processing a time lapse movie that I made today with the 400D on 10mm, but the weather did not prove cooperative, so I posted the movie from a couple of months ago, which is much better. 

Canon likes to create a new charger for each new battery that they create. For a while I was lucky, because the G7 and the 400D use the same battery pack, but the 50D's battery is bigger. This is what it looks like when I need to charge my batteries:

I don't really know what to write on my blog anymore. I'm planning some trips and daily life is very busy, so I should have plenty of things to think about, but for some reason I can't find the impulse to share anything here right now. All I can say is that my brain is clear. This year has been an interesting year for me, with some amazing surprises, but in the end I had about 5 months of really good luck and 5 months of really bad luck. There's still two months left in the year, let's see how this year will end. 

I guess next time I can talk about my obsession with information, my desire to contribute to Java (the programming language), my winter plans, my experiences with the 50D and the 18-200mm lens, or perhaps about buddha and <a href="http://www.sinfest.net/" target="_blank">sinfest </a>:D

Next time.

(There's always a next time!)
