Seeing is more difficult than one might think. Being tired, a person can just walk by the most interesting thing he will see in months. A slight lapse of attention, a quick look in the wrong direction and the moment will be lost. Photography at its core is seeing what is there to see, without missing anything. Don't miss it.
