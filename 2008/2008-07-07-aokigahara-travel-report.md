I thought I'd better write it all down before I forget. Here it is:

<a href="/blog/travel/the-sea-of-trees/" target="_self">Aokigahara travel report</a>

I added a lot of pictures too. Overall I'm quite happy with the photography results. It felt good to pick up my camera again. Even if I didn't take all my equipment I'm still happy with some of the photo's I took, and even the lens I am the least happy with does it's job well when it needs to. Sometimes. Well, there ya go. I'm tired, good night.

...or is it?
