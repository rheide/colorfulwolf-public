Sounds perfect! Exactly the destination for me, out of the way and nobody wants to go there :D

It seems there is this place called Neftegorsk, which was completely abandoned after an earthquake in the nineties, which killed more than half of the population (about 2000 people). Seems interesting, in a creepy kind of way. An abandoned Russian city must be interesting ^_^

The top latitude (longtitude?) seems to be about the same as Holland, can't be too cold then.
