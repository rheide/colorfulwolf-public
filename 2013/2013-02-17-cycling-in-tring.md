Decided to take the train to Tring today, about a 30 minute trip. One of the best things about this country is that you can just take your bicycle in the train. One of the worst things is that when you get out of the train it's still the same boring shit everywhere.

Still, it's exercise, and preparation for an eventual cycling trip this summer, who knows where. Sometimes I wonder if cycling trips are the only thing I'm ever truly looking forward to in life. Vagabonding is my preferred way of life, perhaps?
