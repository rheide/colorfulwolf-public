It would be hard to get a better day than today. In the morning I slept, in the afternoon the weather was awesome. I considered going out for cycling, but I felt rebellious and stayed inside the whole day, doing a little programming project that will have no practical value but feels greet to work on anyway. During sunset I felt like rebelling against my rebelliousness so I went out cycling anyway. I was out of breath at the first hill. Need more training. Or less hills. In the evening I did more programming and spontaneously felt like going out to buy drinks late at night. The stores were closed but it's not bad because the sky smells like summer again. Beautiful!
