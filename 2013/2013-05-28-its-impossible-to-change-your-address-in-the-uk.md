UK banks do this interesting thing to you when you change address: they need a proof of address, which has to be some kind of bill addressed to that address. Unfortunately for me, and probably many others, I don't get any post to my address, ever. I don't pay bills because they're included in my rental contract. The only other thing I receive post about are bank statements, and they're all online. This makes it impossible for me to ever change my address because I am unable to prove that I changed it.

Stupid.
