I've had this idea in my head for most of the day now. Each area of the circle represents an emotional state. Awareness and Routine are happy. Depression and Fading are unhappy. You can transition from routine to awareness or vice versa either via fading or via depression. Depression is the hard transition, fading is the soft transition. At first I thought that the transitions could only occur clockwise, but now I wonder if they can go in any direction. I also think I should define 'Fading' a bit better, as the concept seems lacking compared to the other three.
