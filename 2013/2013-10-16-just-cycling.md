<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">I bought a magnetic cycling trainer thing the other day. You attach your bicycle to it on the rear wheel, connect a roller and it uses magnetic resistance to let you work out indoors. It's shit. I gave it a try today and did not like it. It's noisy and does not feel comfortable at all, nothing like real cycling.</span>

Fortunately for me the day's misery ended in the late afternoon when it stopped raining, so I went out for a proper cycle. I did not regret it. I remembered once again that it doesn't really matter how cold it is outside, as long as it's not raining. Just go out and cycle. It certainly made me feel a lot better after being stuck inside with a cold for 2 days.
