The world has really gone to hell this week, or at least Europe. Riots and torched cards in Sweden, a soldier violently killed in London and riots following. Europe is seriously volatile. Personally I think there's no hope and we should all move somewhere else. Maybe 20 years from now Europe will be a nicer place. But other places will be nicer.

Yes, I'm generalizing here. So what. Decapitate me.
