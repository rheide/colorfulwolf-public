It's decided! :D Next week Kamil and I will fly to Rotterdam, from where we will cycle all the way north to Groningen to my parent's place. Although Kamil will have to leave soon after to go back to work I've booked a ferry back at a later date and will cycle back to London from Harwich. I can't wait!
