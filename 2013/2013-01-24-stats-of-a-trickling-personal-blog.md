Here's Wordpress/Jetpack's <a href="http://jetpack.me/annual-report/24965811/2012/" target="_blank">annual report</a> for this blog in 2012. Not many surprises there. These days my blog gets anywhere between 50-100 hits per day, and more than half of that is from search engines. It's about what you'd expect for a non-focused personal blog. In a way I'm pleased. Even without doing any SEO, even without promoting this blog anywhere, there's still people reading it.
