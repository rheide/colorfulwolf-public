A homeless man in Copenhagen decided to have a rest at an air vent to stay warm, right next to the pigeons. An ambulance arrived at the scene before us. Perhaps someone called them? Perhaps they just passed by? The ambulance crew handed the homeless man a blanket. They didn't take him with them, or to a homeless shelter. I don't know why. Many questions.
