It's hard not to take things personally when I read about <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/26/top-y-combinator-startups/" target="_blank">this year's best Y-Combinator startups</a>Â (Flightcar looks brilliant), or about the owner of Summly <a href="http://hackingdistributed.com/2013/03/26/summly/" target="_blank">instantly becoming a multi-millionaire</a> at age 17. After all, I'm doing things that greatly overlap with them, so it's hard not to compare them to my own situation. There's not really any point or moral to this post. I just felt I should write it and get it out of my system.

Moodlogger.net was about to expire. I decided last month I would let it die since I've got plenty of other things to keep me busy. Despite that decision, today I just couldn't let it rest, and before I knew it, I had renewed the domain. Perhaps it's time to give Moodlogger a second life.
