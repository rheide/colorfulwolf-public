Meh. I'm really not impressed, but then perhaps I have no right to be considering it's a 70GBP camera. The colors are extremely flat and the image is very grainy. It's very much an inferior sensor compared to my old S90. Well, at least now I'm no longer in doubt about whether I should use this camera as my main camera.

If only the S120 could get released soon..

Forgot to mention: the camera took about 1400 photos on one fully charged battery, one every 5 seconds.
