Just now, I was watching a special about the Office UK on the right of my screen, and browsed Office UK videos on youtube on the left. Somehow, I managed to click a video, fairly at random, and I happened to choose a video which had the EXACT SAME FRAGMENT that just appeared on the right side of the screen, within half a second of each other. I AM A WIZARD.

This will never happen again in my entire life.
