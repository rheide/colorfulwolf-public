It was inevitable. For weeks I've been falling asleep at 1Am and waking up at 9AM, even before my alarm goes off. But all during that time, something felt off. It just didn't seem like my natural rhythm. But now, at 4AM (again), I feel much better. Looks like my body has reset itself. Back to normal.
