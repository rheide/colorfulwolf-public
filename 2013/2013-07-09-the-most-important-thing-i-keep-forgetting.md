<h3><strong>It's ok to do nothing.</strong></h3>
I tend to forget this over time in daily life. Because I'm busy all day at work I somehow think that my life is not meaningful if I'm not also busy all the time after work. I try to be 'productive', to make the most efficient use of my time. But sometimes the best thing you can do with your time is <em>nothing</em>. It clears your mind, it puts things into perspective. It makes you happier as a person. The happiest person on earth is not the person who has everything, it's the person who wants nothing.
