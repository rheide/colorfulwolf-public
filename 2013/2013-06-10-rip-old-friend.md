Two days ago I dropped my Canon S90 on a tiled floor. The buttons on the rear are a bit hard to press, but what's worse, the lens won't come out any more. I could probably get it fixed, but it won't come cheap as it's well out of warranty.

I've been looking for a new camera to replace my old friend. I never liked the S110 because it sacrificed GPS tagging for useless wifi connectivity. The S100 didn't seem like a big enough step up from the S90, so I decided to wait and see what the S120 will look like. Being able to run CHDK firmware on it is a big plus for me since it allows me to make timelapse videos easily.

Since the S120 won't be coming out (too) soon I ordered a <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Canon-PowerShot-A2400-Digital-Camera/dp/B0074JZXXY/ref=sr_1_2?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1370866871&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=a2400" target="_blank">Canon A2400IS</a>, since it's cheap and runs CHDK. Since that takes care of my CHDK requirements I feel more free to choose another brand of compact as my main camera, but I'm not really in a hurry to decide. Should I buy a decent compact again to use as my main camera, or shall I stick to DSLRs? I kind of like the Canon 100D..
