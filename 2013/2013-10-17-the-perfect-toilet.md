I have spent too much time thinking about this. Here's what I want from a perfect toilet, in no particular order.
<ul>
	<li>Perfect thermostat.</li>
	<li>Ventilation, openable and closeable while sitting down. Preferably with mosquito net.</li>
	<li>No nooks and crannies! Everything in the room must be visible while on the toilet. No spiders or cockroaches will catch me out!</li>
	<li>Room for plenty of toilet paper. Must be in sight and not create and not create any nooks or crannies.</li>
	<li>A very obvious lock indicator on the door so that other people don't rattle the door to see if someone's in there.</li>
	<li>Entirely optional: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toilets_in_Japan" target="_blank">Japanese toilet seat</a>. I don't actually care much about this but would be nice to have.</li>
	<li>A sink. A goddamn sink.</li>
	<li>Soap. Some godforsaken liquid soap.</li>
	<li>Noise isolation</li>
</ul>
That's all I can think of for now. Anything else?

Why isn't there a startup tackling the toilet problem!? Come on guys, there's a whole new market waiting to be explored!
