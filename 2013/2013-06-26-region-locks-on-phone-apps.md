Seriously, WHY? Why does my phone need to be locked down to only load apps from the UK? What the fuck happened to this global phenomenon called the internet? But no, now I can't even install a maps app just because it's not available in the region I live in. "Android is an open platform" - yeah, right. Only if you take the risk to root your device and install dodgy region changer apps.

The internet is becoming fragmented. This is a bad thing. I am ashamed of the time I live in. We used to have shit technology and great technological freedom. Now we have great technology and no freedom.
