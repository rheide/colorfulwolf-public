Well, I managed to install the little compass onto my bicycle today. As it turns out, it's totally useless and always points towards the center of my handlebars. If you've got a Surly Long Haul Trucker I can pretty guarantee you that the compass will not work, and I'd be very wary of buying it if you've got any kind of steel handlebars. Try it before you buy it.. It's a real shame too because the build quality is excellent and it really does seem like a great product.

Ugh, maybe I should just give in and get something more high-tech..
