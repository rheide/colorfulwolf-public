<blockquote>Choose life. Choose a waifu. Choose an anime. Choose a manga. Choose memorabilia, Blu-Ray DVD's, Master Grade gunpla and 1:1 scale dakimakura. Choose online games, social media and contractual labor. Choose Comiket excursions. Choose your friends. Choose a light novel with predictable storylines and heroines voiced by Kugimiya fucking Rie. Choose image boards and wondering who the fuck you are on a Sunday morning. Choose sitting on that couch watching the same old cliche'd anime season after season, stuffing fucking junk food into your mouth. Choose rotting away at the end of it all, pissing your last in your mother's basement, wondering if choosing not to get a life was worth it in the end. Choose your future. Choose anime... but why would I want to do a thing like that?</blockquote>
