Short thought: Bitcoins will only become more valuable. The reason: based on current supply and demand, the exchange rate has been holding steady around $100/BTC for the past few months. Demand is only expected to increase (massively) as Bitcoin gains widespread adoption. Supply on the other hand, is totally fixed. There's no possible way for the Bitcoin network to generate more than 25 coins every 10 minutes *now*, and this amount will halve again in the future.
