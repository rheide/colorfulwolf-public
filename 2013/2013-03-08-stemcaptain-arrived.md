Today my <a href="http://www.stemcaptain.com/products/stemcaptain-compass-3-0-new/" target="_blank">Â StemCAPtain compass</a> arrived, woohoo! I can't wait to mount it onto my bike. It's a bit pricy but I've already ordered three compass bells from amazon that were all broken. It seems impossible to find a mountable compass for a bicycle online, at least one that isn't a cheap Chinese piece of crap that falls apart when you open the box.

The StemCAPtain (ridiculous capitalization..) looks sturdy and solid, it's made of ALUMNUNUMIMM, and actually points in the right direction.
