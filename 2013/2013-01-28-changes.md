I learned something new about myself recently. Something I used to aspire to be, I now dislike. Something that made me understand and learn about life in the past is now something I actively reject and aspire not to be. Beliefs are becoming more and more fundamental and less able to change. Keeping an open mind while at the same time hearing that voice in the back of your head saying "This is bullshit / I do not agree with this". Not answering that voice initially might be an example of keeping an open mind, but not answering that voice for a long time is just plain cowardice. Once in a while you have to re-evaluate your (moral) stance on things and decide what to accept and what to reject. In doing so I have become more firmly entrenched in believing that my current lifestyle is exactly the way I should be leading my life.
