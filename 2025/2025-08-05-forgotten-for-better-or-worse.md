<p>Google changed their algorithm recently. Previously I could Google myself and still find references to my real name from ages past, from back when I lived in Japan. Nowadays it just seems to be an entry on the UK company house. No more links to blogs, no more fancy algorithm to show you what Google thinks is relevant to your search. Now, Google just shows you what it wants you to see. People have been reporting for many years that Google search has been getting worse, and this is just one more deterioration of many. It&#8217;s sad to see what the internet has become.</p>



<p>Steam recently started banning certain games because Visa and Mastercard decided that they were going to be the internet police of smut and profanity. It started with obvious porn games, but then the net widened to include regular games that happened to have &#8220;questionable&#8221; content, where Visa and Mastercard decide the exact definition of that. And then there was public outrage, because payment processors shouldn&#8217;t be the fucking internet police. But that outrage is now. Once. They&#8217;ll try again, and the second time (it&#8217;s not really the second time, it&#8217;s the umpteenth time) there will be a little bit less outrage. And eventually, eventually they&#8217;ll get away with it. Yet another part of free speech gone. Yet another public place, censored.</p>



<p>The UK is on the forefront of this. Anything you write can and will be used against you. Oh, and no watching porn anymore either unless you submit a video of your face or a proof of ID. And let&#8217;s not even talk about the &#8220;ban on encryption&#8221; (a.k.a. the &#8220;let&#8217;s backdoor everything&#8221; idea) that UK politicians keep proposing time and again only to have it shot down every single time by anyone who is even remotely tech-savvy. So far. I am not optimistic about where this will go. Eventually, ideas that take away your (internet) freedom will slip through, and every time they do, the world gets a little bit worse.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve had a LinkedIn account for over a decade. I barely ever check it because I don&#8217;t think there are many worse cesspools of self-promoting arseholes anywhere else on the internet. The other day I decided to have a look at it and found that I now need a phone number to log in. That seemed silly to me, so I didn&#8217;t bother, but yesterday I tried again, relented and gave them my phone number, only to be blocked again because now they want proof of ID. What an incredible dystopia the internet has turned into.</p>



<p>One might say &#8220;but hey, at least you have VPNs, so you can still be anonymous if you want to be&#8221;. But let&#8217;s be real, VPNs are going to be illegal soon. If you look at what things the UK government already has blocked or wants to block, VPNs are surely on their list of things to make worse. Even if they can&#8217;t stop them from working, the UK can require VPN providers to register in the UK and force them to share their data. Much like the financial network, and now with crypto exchanges, any and all ingress and egress is monitored. And from there, it&#8217;s just a small step to split the internet up into lots of little boxes. &#8220;UKNet&#8221;, perhaps, or &#8220;NationalNet&#8221;. I&#8217;m sure that idea sounds juicy and appetizing to the people in charge.</p>



<p>All of this unfortunately leads me to the conclusion that this blog is dead. Those that know me already will know how to contact me outside of this blog. For those that don&#8217;t know me yet and have just stumbled on this blog.. well, that is not a group that exists any more, because this blog is unfindable now, and that will only get worse over time. At this point in my life, I don&#8217;t think there is any value left in owning and self-hosting a public online property that is tied to my real name. The risks are just too high, and my life will not get better in any way from sharing what&#8217;s going on in my life publicly. That is the world we live in. It&#8217;s not 2005 any more.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m not in a hurry to completely get rid of this blog, but the zeitgeist has changed so much since I started blogging that I just can&#8217;t see this place as &#8220;my cozy place on the internet&#8221; any more. It&#8217;s a constant risk &#8211; either because I&#8217;m worried I&#8217;ll write something that can be misconstrued as offensive or illegal now or ten years from now, or simply because of the perils involved in self-hosting. It&#8217;s very unlikely this site will ever get hacked given that it&#8217;s a static website, but ill-doers could still drive up the monthly bill if they decided to DDoS me. There&#8217;s just no upsides.</p>



<p>So, I guess this is another goodbye. I might continue writing somewhere else, either anonymously or not. I might reach out to people directly, via email or Facebook. But the times, they are changing, and blogging is just not where it&#8217;s at any more. Sayonara. See you elsewhere.</p>
