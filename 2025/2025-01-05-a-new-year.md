<p>Before I went on this winter&#8217;s Japan trip I told myself that the new year wouldn&#8217;t properly begin until after I had cycled Atsugi. I somehow also decided to pile on all my mental issues to be solved on this particular day, when I am in a good mindset to think about all that&#8217;s happened in the past year. I turned 40, lost both my parents, had some health scares and hit an important financial milestone. What a year..</p>



<p>Where has all the time gone? All these events certainly made me reflect on my life a lot. It&#8217;s been suggested to me that I lack <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikigai">ikigai</a>. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever had a clear purpose in all of my life (except once, briefly, a long time ago). The events of this year spurred a certain unrealistic sense of urgency in me, in that I somehow expected myself to find my ikigai on this trip. &#8220;Sure, let&#8217;s just get that pesky little problem out of the way so we can start the next year clean&#8221;. That kind of attitude. Obviously I was stupid about that, and I did not manage to find meaning in life in one day.</p>



<p>While I have no answers yet for any of the major issues I am facing, I think I&#8217;ve gotten better at pinpointing the issues. Ikigai is certainly a big thing for me, but it&#8217;s also an issue that&#8217;s waaaay at the upper end of the hierarchy of needs. It&#8217;s not something that&#8217;s on fire, and I can take my time on finding the right answer. I&#8217;m learning not to conflate my quest for ikigai with more practical issues like the &#8220;where-should-we-live&#8221; problem. It&#8217;s about time we found something nicer for our little family, and perhaps 2025 will be a good year to find our dream house. A third thing that gets conflated into this problem mix for me is how I tend to feel like a completely different person when I&#8217;m in the Netherlands, Japan or the UK. Integrating those parts of myself better is another thing I&#8217;d like to improve on next year. </p>



<p>So my mental image of cycling Atsugi wasn&#8217;t as glorious as it was last year. I was horribly underdressed from the cold, freezing my ass off, and the electric bike&#8217;s battery ran out before the slightly steeper bit, so I was pretty miserable when I came across the scene from the photo above. It&#8217;s one of my favorite roads in Atsugi, the one that leads to the mountains and lake Miyagase. There I found this old man painting the scene, and, looking at him, all my cold and misery just faded away and I felt happy. It was strange. My grandfather was a painter. Perhaps it&#8217;s something I can also find purpose in in the future.</p>



<p>I wish you all well. There will be more to come, and it will be better. Don&#8217;t be in a hurry.</p>
