<p>Jetlag seems to get worse and worse as I get older. Last night I went to bed around midnight, fell asleep pretty quickly, then woke up at 2am and couldn&#8217;t get back to sleep. Ugh. I had planned to cycle to the lake today, which I was pretty excited about at 2am, but by the time it was 6am and I still couldn&#8217;t sleep, I just wanted to stay in bed all day. It&#8217;s costing me a lot of effort lately to just go out and cycle. Still, I managed. Old man, two hours of sleep, chafed nipples, sunburnt face and ears.</p>

<p>Yesterday I ranted about all the humbuggy things that got worse, today I should give props to something that got better: the cycle route along the riverside is just very nice now. There&#8217;s no longer any need to veer off into Hiratsuka to get around some major road or train track. I&#8217;m pretty sure the riverside is now the fastest route between the two cities, given the stupid amount of traffic lights on the main road.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m still committing noob cycling mistakes. Two days ago I wore a base layer that was way too thick for the weather and I ended up with sweat rash on my arms. Today I wore a thin, non-cycling base layer that tends to be really good for everything else, but unfortunately it just got drenched in sweat and did not dry up at all during the cycle, so I was cold and wet by the time I got back to the hotel. Lesson re-learned: I need to get some better base layers. At least I managed to do laundry after I got back. Now it&#8217;s time to catch up on some sleep..</p>
