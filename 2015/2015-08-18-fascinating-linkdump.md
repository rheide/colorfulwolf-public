Yup, I'm still alive :) busy moving apartments, but otherwise still interested in THE FUTURE.

I've also recently finished a <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/scalable-machine-learning-uc-berkeleyx-cs190-1x" target="_blank">Scalable Machine Learning course at edX</a>.

Apache Spark is so much nicer to work with than Hadoop.
