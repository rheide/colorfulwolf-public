We haven't found a house yet, but we are learning many things as we view more properties. Here's some thoughts I had on the topic while searching for a new home.
<ul>
	<li>We're getting better and better at narrowing down properties that are worth viewing.</li>
	<li>As a result, filtering properties is absolutely not an issue after you've started looking. There's only 1 or 2 new properties every day that match our criteria.</li>
	<li>There's no point for me to improve on Gumbug. I could make it better, but manually looking at 2 properties per day, even if they're mismatched, is not a time sink.</li>
</ul>
We'll get there. It's just a matter of time.
