Imagine if you could read a book, while playing a game, while simultaneously watching 2 movies, both played at twice the normal speed. Right now you're thinking: that's a crap idea. Because you can't imagine it. You think you will lose the ability the appreciate each individual activity if you start mixing them up, because that's exactly what happens right now if any normal human tries it. But what if there was a way to train yourself to do this? You'd probably need artificial enhancements. A novel combination of drugs and tDCS might get you a decent way there. Would the life be fundamentally better? Would you gain spectacular new insights that you otherwise never would have had, potentially helping humanity move forward? I believe it's vital to move in this direction, to become better at becoming better.
