Just now, our cat Gracey walked in the room with a bird in his mouth o_0<br /><br />I thought "hey, that's cool", so I reached for my camera and walked back to the cat. Just at that moment he released the bird, and the bird flew away :O It flew to the kitchen, quickly followed by the cat, who jumped on the kitchen sink and caught the bird again. It was still not dead! I tried to release it outside, but the stupid cat caught it again after the bird fell down for the second time. I chased him away, and the bird finally seemed able to fly. But then it fell down again and the neighbours' cat got him -__-<br /><br /><a href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_RIq3e2nKDHo/RsFqcXR52fI/AAAAAAAABUs/ZKuoitz34lk/s1600-h/IMG_0940.jpg"><img style="display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_RIq3e2nKDHo/RsFqcXR52fI/AAAAAAAABUs/ZKuoitz34lk/s400/IMG_0940.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>
