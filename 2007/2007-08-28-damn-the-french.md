French hackers are trying to get into my FTP server in Holland -____-<br /><br />It's amazing. I never turn on my FTP server. I always uploaded my pictures to Holland in a different way, but my server PC is dying now, so I'm forced to use FTP. I've only turned the FTP server on for a couple of hours and (French) people are already trying to hack it... Well good luck, I've blocked you all, bastards.
