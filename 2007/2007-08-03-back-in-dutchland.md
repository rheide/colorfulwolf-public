This is what my province looks like (sometimes) ^_^<br /><br />I managed to catch the flight, get back to Holland, and get back home, thanks to my parents, who were waiting for me at the airport. My first impression: it's so cold here! o_O It's summer though, but it's about 10 degrees colder than in Japan. Quite refreshing. The sky is bright blue, the grass (which I also didn't see in Japan) is wonderfully green, and it's great weather. My parent's told me I brought the good weather with me, because it sucked before I came here. It seems that I also escaped the ty currently approaching the north of Japan. Good luck to my friends trying to head up north to see the festival in Aomori. Be careful, guys!<br /><br />I'm slowly getting used to being back in Holland, and being back home with my parents and my sister :O I found that I'm starting to appreciate Holland in a different way. I like the people, and I like the nature in my province a lot, but as I stay away longer from home, I find myself feeling less and less at home. It's interesting, and this feeling actually makes me appreciate my stay here more :)<br /><br />I'll post some pics later, but it's almost dinner time (every day exactly at 18:00...). ttyl
