10 minutes of internet costs 100 yen here so I'll keep it short. I just noticed they have exactly the same keyboards here as at work -_-. Anyway, I checked in my luggage and I have plenty of time left before the flight leaves. They screwed me over with the currency conversion ofcourse, but that's not something I can worry about too much now. China! I'm looking forward to the flight. This is actually the first time that I'm departing Narita and NOT going to Holland. Should be interesting. I still kind of have the feeling like I going home. This pc is crashing whenever I press backspace so talk to you later!
