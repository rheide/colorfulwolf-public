If only it was a misrecognition, but I'm really 23 o_0 Thanks to everyone for remembering it and congratulating me :) Life in Holland is nice. Quiet and nice. I bought noise canceling headphones before coming here, but I cannot use them, there is no noise! I can hear the static from the noise canceling technology over everything else, because there is simply no noise. It's quiet.<br /><br />I'm still here for another week and a half. Going to visit some friends, do some photographing and some cycling if the weather permits. For now, it's time to eat :D Cya.
