So the tire of my bicycle blew up. Literally. Bam! That was last Thursday, ironically just after fixing someone else's bike.. I got it fixed yesterday and picked up my bicycle this morning, and rode it to work. Halfway. Then the tire blew up again. I cannot believe my own bad luck these days. Did I do something wrong? If so, I apologize, but give me my good luck back, please!
