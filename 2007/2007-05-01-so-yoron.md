Actually only because we were 1 day ahead of schedule and we needed a place to go before Okinawa. So far it`s great! <p>We arrived at around 15:30, at a very weird port, in the middle of nowhere. We cycled to a small town to find out the ferry times and how to get to the camp site at the other side of the island. <p>It took us less than an hour to cross the island, but we did have some trouble: Kamil had a flat tyre about halfway to the campsite :( But even nice Japanese people come to the rescue! We asked a guy who was building a house at the side of the road how far away the campsite was, and he offered to take us there in his tiny pickup truck. We are now making it a habit of taking a picture with all the people that help us on the way, and we`ll email them the pictures later when we get back :)<p>There was nobody at the campsite, only abandoned buildings. We walked to the beach and we found a row of old Japanese women selling seashells and stuff on the way. They were very friendly and helped us call the owner of the campsite, because we wanted to rent a bungalow (actually more like a bird house). The owner, and apparently everyone else on the island was at a festival, which we just missed..<p>While waiting for the owner Kamil fixed his bike, and after we were settled in it had turned dark. We went out on foot to find a restaurant, but we only found apitch black seaside road, with only a few houses on the side, most of them with the lights turned off already. Finally we found something that looked like a restaurant, but it wasn`t. The people inside were nice though, and they pointed us to a supermarket, and even gave us some snacks for on the way!<p>Finally triumphant we returned to our bird house with a super meal of bread, fruit and yoghurt :O<p>Tomorrow we will try to wake up at 5 to catch the sunrise. More later :)
