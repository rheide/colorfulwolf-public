The Transformers movie will only be out in August in Japan, WTF!?!?! I was looking forward to seeing it in July, but now I'll have to see it in Holland. Holland does get it in July by the way. Argh....<br /><br />Anyway, take a look at <a href="http://www.engrish.com/recent_detail.php?imagename=jews-ear-fungus.jpg&amp;category=CHINGLISH&amp;date=2007-05-29">this picture</a>, it will make you laugh.
