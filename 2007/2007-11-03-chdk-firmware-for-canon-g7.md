Take a look here: <a href="http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page">http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page.</a><br />It's called CHDK firmware, and it's an open-source firmware you can put on most Canon Powershot camera's, including the G7. It's great! I get to do a lot of cool stuff now, like:<br /><ul><li>Make RAW photo's</li><li>Create scripts, for example for making time-lapse pictures (don't need my laptop anymore, yay!)</li><li>Play Sokoban on my camera :D</li></ul>It has tons more features so if you have a powershot camera be sure to check it out. Also, the site's complicated and you have to get some quirky binary from a weird Russian page to get it, but it works o_0
