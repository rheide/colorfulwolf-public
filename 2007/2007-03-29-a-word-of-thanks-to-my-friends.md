Because I want to say it in a place where everyone can see it :)<br /><br />I am really proud to have such good friends as you guys. When I leave for China you help me prepare my trip and my ticket. When I am in China you take care of me, show me around and treat me to dinner. And when I go back from China you offer me a place to stay when I miss the last train. When I am sick you help me. When I am unhappy you are unhappy together with me. Well, maybe that last one only applies to Kamil :P I am very lucky to know all of you guys. You know who you are. I will keep our friendship forever!
