I don't know what to say. People are weird. Just a normal working week, and nothing interesting happened, really. Life is just hanging out and relaxing now. I should do more exercise (exorcism?). Maybe next week :D<br /><br />Plans: go to Cheap Cheap. Watch a movie. Maybe play some Counterstrike and Worms together. Sleep until 13:00. Do laundry. Yokohama? Akihabara? Just stay at home? Hiking on Sunday?<br /><br />Well, something like that. I'm tired now. I haven't been very productive today, only helping other people. Lots of other people /o_0\ I feel strange.
