Last Sunday I went with Junko, Youngki and Hung Lun to Mount Takao. It was a good trip We did exactly the same route as when I went last year, but it was good. It was nice to talk to my friends, and it was great weather for photography. Lighting and color were excellent, and I had some nice opportunities to try my new zoom lens.

So.... New blog. Yup. This is it. It looks quite empty to me, compared to my old one, but I can add more pages about generic stuff, not only blogging. I can talk about photography, programming, traveling and whatnot here. If I have the time to do it, that is. In fact, I made this blog about 2-3 months ago, and I still feel that it isn't finished, but I'd better start using it, otherwise it's just a waste of time. So from now on I will post here.

Last Friday all of AK's interns except 2 went clubbing with Wendy! We went to Womb in Shibuya. Music was crappy, but we had fun nonetheless. Early morning Tokyo is not complete without a visit to the fish market, so we did that too. Sushi was exquisite ^_^. I put crappy movies of the club on youtube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ3vTBKRPfk" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FcPDgyrj8c" target="_blank">here</a>.

So, here we are. Two years have passed since I came to Japan.  I have changed, but I have not changed. My foundation is strong and does not change. I have gained experience and I am a bit closer to finding out what it is that I really want. But I'm not there yet. I've only just started.
