I honestly cannot remember when the last time was that I actually looked forward to the weekend. Somehow the working days and the weekend always seemed to connect seamlessly, and I never thought about weekend as being more or less nice than a working day. This week seems different somehow, but I can't figure out why.<br /><br />I've got no plans for tomorrow at all! We're doing a barbecue on Sunday, and we did some preparation for that today, but it's nothing serious, so I don't think I have to do much at all tomorrow. Sleeping will do fine I guess. I am enjoying the silence of my room when my airconditioning and my PC are switched off. Usually I am either downloading something or it's too hot or too cold in my room to not use the aircon, but lately the weather is perfect and I don't have much to download, so I can enjoy sleeping in silence.<br /><br />Yesterday I had a really long, boring meeting for the whole day at work, so feeling kind of unsatisfied with not programming for a whole day I started to think about a personal programming project during my free time, and I think I've found the perfect thing to keep me occupied whenever I am bored ^_^ I won't say anything yet, because I know myself and it will most likely end up to be a half finished project since I can't be motivated for programming stuff that's not work-related. It has the potential to be huge, and I can start really small. Which is good, since most of the time I will be too lazy or too busy to program. It's a nice goal for me anyway, to have something to work towards during my free time.<br /><br /><br />Here's some pictures from the second day of Moron no Tabi.<br /><br /><a href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_RIq3e2nKDHo/Rk2eYqBTNzI/AAAAAAAAAWI/jQMNpTdJkic/s1600-h/IMG_5935.jpg"><img style="display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_RIq3e2nKDHo/Rk2eYqBTNzI/AAAAAAAAAWI/jQMNpTdJkic/s400/IMG_5935.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>Along the coast of Amakusa in Kyushu. There's a wonderful road going along the coast from North to South, sometimes going up a hill a bit, then down again, sometimes around a small town in a valley below, and sometimes right next to the sea and the beautiful rocky cliffs.<br /><br /><br /><a href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_RIq3e2nKDHo/Rk2eZKBTN0I/AAAAAAAAAWQ/oyc2QO1_xfE/s1600-h/IMG_6023.jpg"><img style="display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_RIq3e2nKDHo/Rk2eZKBTN0I/AAAAAAAAAWQ/oyc2QO1_xfE/s400/IMG_6023.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>We managed to make it to the ferry to Nagashima in time, and we rode the ferry while the sun was setting on us.<br /><br /><a href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_RIq3e2nKDHo/Rk2eZqBTN1I/AAAAAAAAAWY/_5w8nunowkw/s1600-h/IMG_6043.jpg"><img style="display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_RIq3e2nKDHo/Rk2eZqBTN1I/AAAAAAAAAWY/_5w8nunowkw/s400/IMG_6043.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>We rode on until dark, and managed to see this beautiful sunset from a hill shortly after our arrival at Nagashima.<br /><br /><a href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_RIq3e2nKDHo/Rk2eZqBTN2I/AAAAAAAAAWg/gZtjNsilCUE/s1600-h/IMG_6050.jpg"><img style="display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_RIq3e2nKDHo/Rk2eZqBTN2I/AAAAAAAAAWg/gZtjNsilCUE/s400/IMG_6050.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>As we reached our final destination for that day the sun finally set, and we enjoyed a good meal of rice and Japanese fish ^^
