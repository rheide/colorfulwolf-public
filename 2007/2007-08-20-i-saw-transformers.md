And it sucked... I didn't like it. Just an average Bay action movie, it could have been about anything, as long as he has a reason to include lots of explosions and stupid meaningless action scenes. That being said, I would love such a stupid pointless action movie if it was done properly, but this just wasn't it. Erratic camera movements don't make an action movie action-y... It just makes it crappy. And Transformers are huge giant robots, not fucking ninjas... I am disappointed indeed.<br /><br />On the bright side: I did go to Groningen, had an interesting meeting, and I shot some cool photo's at the station on the way back. I still find myself relying on Photoshop to correct the errors I made when taking the picture the though..<br /><br /><a href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_RIq3e2nKDHo/Rsno2bR1bVI/AAAAAAAABbw/Cl2hqTKm9ec/s1600-h/IMG_1608.jpg"><img style="display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_RIq3e2nKDHo/Rsno2bR1bVI/AAAAAAAABbw/Cl2hqTKm9ec/s320/IMG_1608.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>
