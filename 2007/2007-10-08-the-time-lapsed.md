<a href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_RIq3e2nKDHo/RwpK9fVG_5I/AAAAAAAAD6o/eckptOBAZ0o/s1600-h/IMG_1766.jpg"><img style="display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_RIq3e2nKDHo/RwpK9fVG_5I/AAAAAAAAD6o/eckptOBAZ0o/s400/IMG_1766.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>And I captured it. The clouds were disappearing as the sun started to set, and after the sun disappeared it lit the clouds from below. A beautiful sight which only lasted for about 15 minutes. I made a time lapse video of the cloud movement from around 15:00 to 18:00. You can find the crappy quality version on youtube<a href="http://jp.youtube.com/watch?v=fDSZamAGuR8"> here</a> (please rate it!), and the high quality version on my webspace <a href="http:///2007_10_08_Web.avi">here</a>. Enjoy it while it lasts!
