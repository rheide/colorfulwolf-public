Sometimes people from two different worlds, with no connection to each other at all, meet. It's very strange, and it's like a dead person meeting a living person. Ok, we watched a weird Thai horror movie tonight, so I might be influenced a little, but I still think it's weird whenever people I know in Japan meet people I know in Holland.<br /><br />Uh, yeah. That's it. Nothing to report. Move along folks.
