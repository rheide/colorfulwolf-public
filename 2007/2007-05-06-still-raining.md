So we arrived in Naha, tired as hell and in a big rainstorm. We found a nice cheap Ryokan to stay at, and this morning we sent our luggage (bike bags, dirty clothes, tent etc.) by Kuroneko. We were planning on going to the beach today if the weather was nice, but it still sucks. Raining just as much as yesterday. Today we're trying out the local internet cafe and walking around in the city. Tomorrow the weather should be nice, so the plan is to go to the beach, swim a lot, drive to the airport, take apart the bikes and take the plane back ^_^ If the weather is nice. Pray for us...<br /><br />(Okinawan taco's are delicious!)
