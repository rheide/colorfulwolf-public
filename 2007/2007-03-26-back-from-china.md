Still alive! I want to make one thing absolutely clear for everyone:<br /><br /><span style="font-size:180%;">I did <span style="font-weight:bold;">_NOT_</span> get robbed!</span><br /><br />It's a nice experience to walk into the office in the morning, and people don't ask you things like "how was your trip?", but instead they ask "did you get robbed?". Am I that innocent-looking? Holland is more scary than Japan and I never got robbed there!<br /><br />..anyway, I'll make a nice travel report with nice pictures later, so check back here again later!
