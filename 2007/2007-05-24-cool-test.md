Liou found a cool test: <a href="http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/JTypes2.asp">http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/JTypes2.asp</a><br />It tests your personality profile according to Jung.<br /><br />Apparently I am a <a href="http://keirsey.com/personality/nfij.html">Counselor Idealist</a> (iNFj). It sounds cool, but I think it might be a bit exaggerated, but I still recognize a lot of myself in the profile. I do get the feeling that I might have a completely different profile one year later though.
