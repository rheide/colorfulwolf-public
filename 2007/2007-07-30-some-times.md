When it's finally time to start packing, as usual, I don't feel like doing much, so I'm posting on my blog. A quick recap of the last episode: my work varies from unusually quiet and relaxing periods to ridiculously busy periods, and my personal life varies from great happiness to great pissed-off-ness. Finally, I'm going home on Wednesday, and I feel both happy and sad.<br /><br />Yesterday it started to thunderstorm here, and it hasn't stopped yet. I've made some nice movies with my camera and new lens. I bought a lens on Sunday, when we went to Yokohama, planning to buy a discount Shinkansen ticket. When we arrived the woman at the travel agency told us that it was only available to foreigners outside of Europe. Unlucky again...<br /><br />Clich√©s annoy me, but this one is true: "You only know what you are missing after it's gone"<br /><br />Also, Casino Royale sucks donkeyballs. James Bond is not such a loser.
