It was great! Back in Atsugi I tried to open my bicycle lock and my key broke off. Shit. Went to the police box in front of the station, and they had some pliers I could use to open the lock. Back home the same thing happened again with my spare key. I guess I'll have to get a new lock tomorrow...<br /><br />(I actually wanted to write interesting stuff here, but my brain just went back to sleep. It's been sleeping since Sunday evening o_0)
