Take a look at Kamil's blog for the list of 10 most weird drinks in Japan o_0 Here's a pic of the Ice Cucumber Pepsi from the local conbini...<br /><br /><a href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_RIq3e2nKDHo/RnfpcLJ36GI/AAAAAAAABOQ/4ugiFfvVMQw/s1600-h/IMG_0071.jpg"><img style="display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_RIq3e2nKDHo/RnfpcLJ36GI/AAAAAAAABOQ/4ugiFfvVMQw/s400/IMG_0071.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />So what's up? Since my sister arrived live has been going on as usual for me. Still have to go to work, still busy as hell sometimes :'( The fact that my sister's here does give me a good reason to revisit all the nice restaurants I have been storing in my memory since I've been here ^_^ It's nice to show her all the good places to eat, even though she doesn't need me at all and has been doing quite well by herself :O She went to Yokohama by herself today while I was working. I'm quite impressed :)
