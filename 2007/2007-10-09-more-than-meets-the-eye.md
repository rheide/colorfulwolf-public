The photo was overexposed, so I just ran a crappy filter over it and got this picture.<br /><br />Recently I saw an anime called Gurren Lagann. I have never seen anything more 'over the top' than that anime. It makes you believe that you can do anything with fighting spirit and raw emotion. A typical anime I guess, but it's the most over the top one I've seen yet. I like it a lot :D It's what this country is missing, apparently, according to <a href="http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/ek20071009ks.html">this article</a> anyway.<br /><br />I'm learning Chinese WTF!! o_0. I got some really basic study books a couple of months ago, and I'm finally starting to learn. Wendy is helping me practice the pronunciation, and I suck at it. I haven't even started to learn Chinese characters or words, but at least I'm practicing the pronunciation ^_^. Today for the first time I got the feeling that I might actually be able to learn it. It would still take ten years, but hey, it's better than nothing -_-.<br /><br />Meh, going to bed. Sleepy.
