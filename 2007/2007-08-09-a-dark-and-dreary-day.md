But it's not all bad. It's just after dinner now, and it's starting to clear up! Yesterday my parents and my sister gave me a wonderful birthday present: a Canon 400D! ^_^ I've been playing with it all day yesterday, and today Shanna brought me to a cool photo store. We got some cool filters, but I think I'll hold out on buying lenses until I'm back in Japan. They're a lot cheaper there :O<br /><br />Anyway, here's some pics. They also gave me a 70-300mm zoom lens, and I was playing with it just now after the weather cleared up :D<br /><br /><a href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_RIq3e2nKDHo/RrtPpXR52bI/AAAAAAAABUI/gL78viQg_Pw/s1600-h/IMG_0152.JPG"><img style="display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_RIq3e2nKDHo/RrtPpXR52bI/AAAAAAAABUI/gL78viQg_Pw/s400/IMG_0152.JPG" alt="" border="0" /></a>A Dutch castle (according to the sign anyway...)<br /><br /><br /><a href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_RIq3e2nKDHo/RrtPpnR52cI/AAAAAAAABUQ/Pe7-M6qn80w/s1600-h/IMG_0256.JPG"><img style="display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_RIq3e2nKDHo/RrtPpnR52cI/AAAAAAAABUQ/Pe7-M6qn80w/s400/IMG_0256.JPG" alt="" border="0" /></a>Playing around with an infrared Cokin filter. The flare is because I don't have an adapter for my lens, so I just put it in front of the camera.<br /><br /><br /><a href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_RIq3e2nKDHo/RrtPp3R52dI/AAAAAAAABUY/VrQ--lMZOyY/s1600-h/IMG_0272.JPG"><img style="display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_RIq3e2nKDHo/RrtPp3R52dI/AAAAAAAABUY/VrQ--lMZOyY/s400/IMG_0272.JPG" alt="" border="0" /></a>Playing with the zoom lens.
