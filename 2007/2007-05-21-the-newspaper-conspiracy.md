It happened again. Today, shortly after I arrived back home from sushi. I had barely closed the door of my room, when the doorbell rang. They found me. They are coming for me.<br /><br />They came before. They always seem to know where you are, and they never cease to haunt you. It's like a cult, and it's members are relentless. They will not stop until you are either dead, or a part of their cult. There is no stopping them. They will try again and again until you grow weary and cannot resist any longer. It is a terror every foreigner in Japan must have faced.<br /><br />The newspaper guy.<br /><br />NO! I CANNOT F*&amp;$%#*CKING READ JAPANESE!!!! GET THE F%*#&amp;%CK AWAY FROM ME!!!<br /><br />Argh. In the last two weeks I must have had a newspaper guy come by room every day to try and get me to read the stupid Japanese newspaper. Sometimes it works to tell them I don't speak Japanese. Sometimes it works if I tell them I don't read Japanese. Sometimes they just try to sell you an English newspaper instead. Next time I see one I"ll try speaking in Dutch. But the conspiracy is broad, and I'm sure that next time they'll try to sell me a Dutch newspaper...<br /><br /><br /><a href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_RIq3e2nKDHo/RlGKnqBTN9I/AAAAAAAAAXY/2b2is_fnhuk/s1600-h/IMG_6173.jpg"><img style="display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_RIq3e2nKDHo/RlGKnqBTN9I/AAAAAAAAAXY/2b2is_fnhuk/s400/IMG_6173.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><a href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_RIq3e2nKDHo/RlGKn6BTN-I/AAAAAAAAAXg/cyT85irSs-M/s1600-h/IMG_6176.jpg"><img style="display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_RIq3e2nKDHo/RlGKn6BTN-I/AAAAAAAAAXg/cyT85irSs-M/s400/IMG_6176.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />These pics are from Kagoshima, Sakurajima, the active volcano island next to the city. We were stupid enough to drive our bicycles and heavy luggage up 375 meters to a lookout point. 2 hours up, 6 minutes down. Top speed: 67kph. Not bad ^_^
