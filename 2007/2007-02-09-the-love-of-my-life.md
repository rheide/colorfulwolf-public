The love of my life. I should talk about this for once, because I never give her proper credit. She never abandons me. I can always rely on her. We always travel to nice places together. I've known her ever since I came to Japan. We only had problems once. It took some patching, but after that our relationship was better than ever, and we've never had any problems since then. I go to work with her everyday. Sometimes I neglect her, and she's been making squeaky sounds since a couple of months. She doesn't know how to stop. Her makeup is falling off. She's not as 'together' anymore now. She's getting old. When I bought her she was brand new. Now she's showing signs of wear. I know everbody's wondering about who I'm talking about. I've added a picture of her. Still the love of my life :D<br /><br /><a href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_RIq3e2nKDHo/RcvLngyeF7I/AAAAAAAAAKs/YDyj6fTFgjg/s1600-h/IMG_2425.JPG"><img style="display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_RIq3e2nKDHo/RcvLngyeF7I/AAAAAAAAAKs/YDyj6fTFgjg/s400/IMG_2425.JPG" alt="" border="0" /></a>(as you can see, it's clearly a 'she'-bike o_0 )<br />I bought her the third day I came to Japan. At a big department store for 11.000 yen, which translates to about 75 euro's with the current crappy exchange rate. In hindsight I could have bought a cheaper bike somewhere else, or a second-hand bike, or I could just have waited until someone left, which would get me a free bike. One day after I bought my bike, I took the newly arrived Jose to the same place, where he bought the same bike as me. Lately everyone's bike has been breaking down a lot. Except for these two bikes. They always work :)<br /><br />Here's some random pics I took recently.<br /><br /><a href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_RIq3e2nKDHo/RcvL2QyeF8I/AAAAAAAAAK0/trTfvp1GQTw/s1600-h/IMG_2378.JPG"><img style="display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_RIq3e2nKDHo/RcvL2QyeF8I/AAAAAAAAAK0/trTfvp1GQTw/s320/IMG_2378.JPG" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />Atsugi's station. It's called Hon Atsugi, which sorta mean 'main station of Atsugi'. There's another station but it's crappy and nobody goes there.<br /><br /><a href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_RIq3e2nKDHo/RcvMBQyeF-I/AAAAAAAAALE/7fksqLKvOEI/s1600-h/IMG_2403.JPG"><img style="display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_RIq3e2nKDHo/RcvMBQyeF-I/AAAAAAAAALE/7fksqLKvOEI/s320/IMG_2403.JPG" alt="" border="0" /></a>Somewhere in Tokyo.

It looked quite surrealistic in real life. The picture just looks strange.<br /><br />Optimus Prime greets you from the top of my PC at work!<br /><br /><a href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_RIq3e2nKDHo/RcvMHAyeF_I/AAAAAAAAALM/UIgDP-09VHg/s1600-h/IMG_2388.JPG"><img style="display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_RIq3e2nKDHo/RcvMHAyeF_I/AAAAAAAAALM/UIgDP-09VHg/s320/IMG_2388.JPG" alt="" border="0" /></a>
