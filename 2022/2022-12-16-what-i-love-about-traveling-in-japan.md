<p>I always end up feeling lucky when I travel in Japan. It&#8217;s a country that rewards you for being unprepared. For example, yesterday we had to get from Kawaguchiko to Shizuoka. There&#8217;s no easy way purely by train, but Kawaguchiko has a bunch of busses, so I left it until the morning we left to decide how we&#8217;d end up in Shizuoka. It turns out the bus line I found online wasn&#8217;t running, but the ticket office attendant suggested we take the local bus all the way around Mount Fuji to end up in Fuji town at the seaside. </p>



<p>The local bus turned out to be a great pick: if took us past all the surrounding lakes on a scenic tour of the area. There were only 5 people in the entire bus, since it&#8217;s the off season. Most tourists end up taking the trains or buses back to Tokyo. I really enjoy experiences like this &#8211; it&#8217;s little off-the-beaten-path finds that make otherwise crowded tourist destinations even more enjoyable. And with a beautiful blue sky as the backdrop, what more could you want? </p>



<p>It&#8217;s hard for me not to contrast this experience with that of other countries. Some other countries might &#8216;punish&#8217; you in this situation, by forcing you to spend more money or time to get to your destination. When we traveled Cuba we tried to take a bus from the far end of the island back to Havana and had to wait until the last minute until we were sure we&#8217;d even get a seat, despite having been reassured that we wouldn&#8217;t have to reserve. And then of course that bus randomly &#8216;turned off&#8217; several times in the middle of the night as we were moving, causing the driver to have to clutch-drop on a downhill to get the thing going again. Or England, where I&#8217;ve run into plenty of cases where public transport was just cancelled or delayed without further notice. But in Japan, supported by its excellent infrastructure and incredibly helpful locals, you are rewarded, because there&#8217;s always another way to get to where you want to go.</p>



<p>People travel for a lot of reasons: culture, meeting people, activities. As for me, I get a lot of enjoyment out of taking in the scenery. The aesthetic of places always appeals to me, and it&#8217;s usually one of my main goals each trip to visit a place with a beautiful view. But I also appreciate the easthetic of &#8216;boring&#8217;, normal locations. A long road leading from the suburbs into a city, with restaurants, car shops and malls on either side, might sound pretty generic, but there&#8217;s a uniqueness in how each country (and each city) plays the theme. Perhaps it&#8217;s not beautiful in the traditional way, but Japan&#8217;s take on it is definitely unmistakeably Japanese. That, to me, makes it interesting. It&#8217;s great to be able to experience that again.</p>
