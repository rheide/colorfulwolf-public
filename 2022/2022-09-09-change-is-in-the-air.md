<p>When you&#8217;ve kept your head down for a long time you might be surprised at where you are when you finally look up again. That&#8217;s what it feels like right now.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s been an odd day. My life in general is pretty normal lately. As a fairly boring middle-aged person I sometimes have month after month where nothing of significance happens. Those days just fly by. But then, suddenly, something happens that jolts me from normality, and I realize fully where and when I am. Today was such a day.</p>



<p>First, my wife finally received her British passport. It has been a long wait for her since she first applied for citizenship, but today the last remaining worry was finally dispelled and she can travel freely again. This is amazing. One less thing to worry about.</p>



<p>Second, I met an old friend for dinner in London. It might be the last time I see him in a while because he&#8217;s leaving the UK, as a lot of my (software developer) friends have done in the last couple of years. Increasing costs of living in the UK make London an increasingly hard sell for a lot of people I know, so inevitably many of them are returning to their home country. The general concensus among people in my circle seems to be that London is fine for a couple of years &#8211; you earn some decent money, live the life, meet the people &#8211; but then it&#8217;s time to move on and go somewhere else so that you can have a better quality of life.</p>



<p>Most of my friends have left London now, either to move to places just outside of London, or further away. I&#8217;m not quite the last holdout but on days like today it certainly feels like it. It reminds me of the time when I left Japan and I was the last foreigner in my group of friends to leave. Being the last to leave is an interesting feeling. I certainly felt that same melancholy today, and it made me remember my past self.</p>



<p>Third, this happened:</p>

<p>The queen died. As I was walking to the tube station I passed by Piccadilly Circus, which was full of tourists and other random people, just standing there in a daze, staring at and taking photos of the giant billboard that was showing the queen. They all seemed a bit bewildered, wondering about what was going to happen next. </p>



<p>So I look up at the billboard and I realize that the world has changed so much recently. Ukraine happened. Covid happened. My life in the UK happened. And the queen is dead. Who knows what will happen next.  </p>
