<p>It&#8217;s been an interesting year for me. Not-so-great things happened in the years before, but this year it really felt like things were starting to look up again. It&#8217;s been great to be able to go on holiday to Japan and spend some time away from the drudges of daily life, while also being in the right mindset to properly appreciate the time away. Today, sitting at the riverside, listening to music, it felt amazing to just take in the scenery and be in the moment. It&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve not done nearly enough lately.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m getting older. I&#8217;m not the same person I used to be when I lived here, already more than ten years ago. I&#8217;ve got different priorities, different hobbies. Being back here feels like I am meeting my past self, exposing all those changes I otherwise don&#8217;t really think about. There&#8217;s some things that my past self and I have differing opinions on, and being where I used to live a long time ago those differences become readily apparent. It&#8217;s a valuable and interesting experience, because it helps me appreciate how I&#8217;ve changed, for better and for worse.</p>



<p>Lastly, I was able to test if I could still enjoy Japan in the same way that I used to enjoy it back then. This, at least, is one part of me that hasn&#8217;t changed. I don&#8217;t think anyone I&#8217;ve met here has experienced Japan in quite the same way I did (and that&#8217;s only natural &#8211; everyone has their own story to tell). The way I intrinsically appreciate Japan is mine and mine alone, and not something I can easily put into words. But even after 17 years that feeling is still there, and I can still find those golden moments here. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll ever get tired of Japan.</p>



<p>Happy new year everyone.</p>
