Apparently Google Analytics might become illegal soon in the Netherlands. It reminded me that I still had a Google Analytics script on this blog, which I've now removed. No more tracking!

Side note: bit rot is real. I had to update various Python libs to their latest version to make this static blog platform work with the latest Python. The maintenance burden is real.
