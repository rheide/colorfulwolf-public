Although in the previous post I lamented about wishing I'd stayed on Wordpress, a day after I published that this <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer" href="https://rootprivileges.net/2022/04/03/what-are-you-doing-wordpress-com/">article about wordpress.com pricing model issues</a> became the top post on Hacker News. Just changing out the pricing model for their existing users seems like a practice that would certainly have made me unhappy if I had been their customer. It made me feel slightly better about the time I spent on this blog. But only slightly.

And speaking of ancient technologies, since it seems I'll be on my self-built platform for a while I added support for RSS feed generation to my static blog platform. The front page now has an RSS feed, though I likely won't bother to add feeds for categories, tags or article comments unless there's more early-2010s nostalgia fans like me out there.

I'm still thinking about publishing this on Github but I know there's tons of static blog solutions out there that are way better than mine, so I've not been in a hurry. It's on my todo list though.
