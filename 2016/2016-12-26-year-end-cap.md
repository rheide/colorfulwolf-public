Observations:
<ul>
 	<li>I got married!</li>
 	<li>I question whether this blog adds value to my real life any more.</li>
 	<li>Compared to 2015 I am cycling more and am fitter.</li>
 	<li>Being fitter has helped me keep my peace of mind during stressful situations at work.</li>
 	<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_point_(game_theory)">Schelling points</a> and <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/ase/schelling_fences_on_slippery_slopes/" target="_blank">fences</a>Â are fascinating.</li>
 	<li>Next year I wish to speak my mind more freely among my friends.</li>
 	<li>I increasingly want to be part of a community again.</li>
 	<li>I actually typed a really long post for the end-of-year event but decided not to post it.</li>
</ul>
Prep work is done. Time to make a move.
