I've been following three 'principles' of sorts lately. I think they've been quite useful for me. Maybe they'll work on other people too. In no particular order:
<ul>
 	<li>Own it - whatever you do, don't feel embarrassed about it. Pretend if you have to. Eventually it becomes second nature.</li>
 	<li>Always leave something left to do for the next opportunity. Be it programming, gaming, travel, or that TV show that you were intending to binge-watch. Leaving something open means it's easy to get back into things the next time.</li>
 	<li>Avoid procrastination by not thinking things through too much and just taking the first step. Don't try to solve the entire thing in your head from beginning to end, just start somewhere and keep making progress incrementally. It works for me especially on the things I don't like, because once I've started I feel like I might as well finish it.</li>
</ul>
Mental health, y'all.
