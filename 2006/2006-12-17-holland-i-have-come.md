I arrived in Holland yesterday.<br /><br />It's 7:30 in the morning and I'm sitting in the couch in the living room of my parent's house. I arrived in Holland yesterday at 4 in the afternoon, and we were back home at 7. Since I was really sleepy I didn't do much and went to sleep at 10. I was planning on sleeping until noon, but my stupid alarm clock prevented that. The damn thing went off at 6:30 in the morning, which was the exact time I set the last time when I was in Holland, when I had to make the place back to Japan. I guess no one bothered to turn it off for all those 7 months that I was gone... :'(<br /><br />I wasn't sleepy at all so I just woke up and went downstairs. It's unbelievable how dark and quiet Holland is. When flying over Holland yesterday I realised for the first time how small Holland really is. There's nothing there! Only farmland and highways. There's barely any towns or cities, especially in the region where I come from. It's so very dark. Barely and lights along the highways, and a very sharp contrast with Japan, where it's impossible to find a dark spot within a 100km radius of Tokyo. I will say that I prefer my bed in Holland because of this. There is not a single sound, and it hasn't been so quiet for me since last time I came here in May.<br /><br />What was going to be a week of doing nothing and relaxing will turn out to be quite a busy week actually. My mother's birthday party, the Christmas party, meeting friends, buying stuff, going to the dentist (yes, really.. yuck T_T )... Today I will take my time and relax though. I'm going to need it since I woke up way too early, and I will probably be sleepy for the rest of the day..<br /><br />Anyway, here's some pictures for you to look at.<br /><a href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_RIq3e2nKDHo/RYTmxglQI8I/AAAAAAAAABU/TEFXwvmjt5M/s1600-h/IMG_0033.JPG"><img style="display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_RIq3e2nKDHo/RYTmxglQI8I/AAAAAAAAABU/TEFXwvmjt5M/s320/IMG_0033.JPG" alt="" border="0" /></a>On the way to Narita, somewhere around Yokohama I think, but not sure.<br /><br /><a href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_RIq3e2nKDHo/RYTm6QlQI9I/AAAAAAAAABc/PySvDgK-kzA/s1600-h/IMG_0069.JPG"><img style="display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_RIq3e2nKDHo/RYTm6QlQI9I/AAAAAAAAABc/PySvDgK-kzA/s320/IMG_0069.JPG" alt="" border="0" /></a>My home for 12 hours: KLM's Rio de Janeiro.<br /><a href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_RIq3e2nKDHo/RYTnEQlQI-I/AAAAAAAAABk/KKNDSKAyh_M/s1600-h/IMG_0142.JPG"><img style="display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_RIq3e2nKDHo/RYTnEQlQI-I/AAAAAAAAABk/KKNDSKAyh_M/s320/IMG_0142.JPG" alt="" border="0" /></a>I'm going to Hokkaido for one week after Holland, but here it is already! ^_^<br /><a href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_RIq3e2nKDHo/RYTnOglQI_I/AAAAAAAAABs/T7mNwLoE5ZQ/s1600-h/IMG_0145.JPG"><img style="display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_RIq3e2nKDHo/RYTnOglQI_I/AAAAAAAAABs/T7mNwLoE5ZQ/s320/IMG_0145.JPG" alt="" border="0" /></a>I've been to Sapporo too :D<br /><a href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_RIq3e2nKDHo/RYTnlwlQJBI/AAAAAAAAAB8/mwrFK5mFTuA/s1600-h/IMG_0164.JPG"><img style="display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_RIq3e2nKDHo/RYTnlwlQJBI/AAAAAAAAAB8/mwrFK5mFTuA/s320/IMG_0164.JPG" alt="" border="0" /></a>Catching the sunset somewhere before Scandinavia.<br /><a href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_RIq3e2nKDHo/RYTnvglQJCI/AAAAAAAAACE/nKkKwxhJf_s/s1600-h/IMG_0197.JPG"><img style="display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_RIq3e2nKDHo/RYTnvglQJCI/AAAAAAAAACE/nKkKwxhJf_s/s320/IMG_0197.JPG" alt="" border="0" /></a>My first views of Holland in 7 months!<br /><a href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_RIq3e2nKDHo/RYTn7glQJDI/AAAAAAAAACM/VHv-wNItbS4/s1600-h/IMG_0231.JPG"><img style="display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_RIq3e2nKDHo/RYTn7glQJDI/AAAAAAAAACM/VHv-wNItbS4/s320/IMG_0231.JPG" alt="" border="0" /></a>Driving back home playing with my camera.<br /><br /><a href="http://bp0.blogger.com/_RIq3e2nKDHo/RYToFglQJEI/AAAAAAAAACU/Wv73PwwnWB4/s1600-h/IMG_0242.JPG"><img style="display:block;text-align:center;cursor:pointer;margin:0 auto 10px;" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_RIq3e2nKDHo/RYToFglQJEI/AAAAAAAAACU/Wv73PwwnWB4/s320/IMG_0242.JPG" alt="" border="0" /></a>Crappy picture of me in our living room, next to the Christmas tree.<br /><br />I'll post some more pictures later of the house, Holland, and of course, our cats ^_^
