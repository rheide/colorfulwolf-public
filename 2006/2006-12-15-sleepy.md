Yesterday was one of the craziest days in my life in Japan so far, and going to Akihabara to buy a camera only hours before I leave for Holland still seemed like a great idea, even after walking for hours to find a store that actually has the camera that I want... Anyway, I bought the camera, had nice steak for dinner, and now I've packed up and I'm ready to go! It's 5:50 in the morning. My bus leaves at 7:10. Perfect moment for blogging ^^. I'll talk more later about the crazy day and the crazy week, for now I'll say: see you in Holland :)
