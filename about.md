<p>
This blog is my personal blog and my home on the internet ever since I've moved from the Netherlands
to Japan.
</p>

<p>
I write about technology, cycling, traveling, random thoughts and all kinds of things.
</p>

<p>
While many things I post on this blog should give strong clues to my identity, I'm aiming for this
to be a one-way mapping: if you know me, you'll know about this blog, but if you only know about
this blog, it should be a little bit harder to find me. I'm under no illusions though;
this is the internet, and any reasonably dedicated individual should be able to find out my identity
based on the clues I have posted on this site. That's ok though, any person who is sufficiently
dedicated to actually do that must have a good reason. Drop me a line if you do!
