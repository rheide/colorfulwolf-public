<p>This week has just been full of surprises. A while ago I was diagnosed with a long-term disease that affects what I&#8217;m allowed to eat and drink. Today I was diagnosed with a second long-term disease that also affects what I&#8217;m allowed to eat and drink. I&#8217;ve barely reached middle age, but the doctor was quite clear that the changes to my body are irreversible, and I won&#8217;t be able to keep the same lifestyle that I used to have when I was younger.</p>



<p>That came as quite a shock to me, even though I knew it shouldn&#8217;t. I know I&#8217;ve got health issues I should take better care of, but I always seem to get away with things as long as I occasionally do something healthy to counteract all the unhealthy things I&#8217;m also doing. That definitely seems over now. I&#8217;ll need to severely limit myself in what I eat and drink, otherwise I&#8217;m very likely to die. It&#8217;s as simple as that.</p>



<p>Initially, when I heard the diagnosis, I felt upset, because I didn&#8217;t want to lose what I had. I was happy with my life, I didn&#8217;t want to make changes. But now that I&#8217;ve thought about it, and now that it&#8217;s absolutely clear that it&#8217;s just necessary, it just seems fine to me. Just another thing I have to do to survive. I think I can adjust my mindset to accept the new reality, but only time will tell. Time never stops.</p>
