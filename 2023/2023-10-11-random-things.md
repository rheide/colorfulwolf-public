<p>I&#8217;ve not written much lately, which isn&#8217;t unusual. I used to blame lack of time for that, but in terms of available time, I have time to write. But I choose to spend most of that time elsewhere these days and don&#8217;t feel much like blogging. It feels like, at this point in my life, not much is happening that is worth reporting on publicly.</p>



<p>I&#8217;d write about public events or general content, but those posts tend to require a bit more time and preparation, especially in this day and age where the internet is getting more and more locked down and you can get &#8220;cancelled&#8221; for saying one wrong word. Blogging has become an ever increasing risk with lower and lower returns. I&#8217;d like to keep doing it, but things like the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/09/uk-online-safety-bill-will-mandate-dangerous-age-verification-much-web">UK Online Safety Bill</a> really make me wonder if it&#8217;s still worth it. Running a blog on your own domain with all kinds of cool features has never been easier from a technical point of view, but it&#8217;s just increasingly not worth it.  </p>



<p>Callback to my post about <a href="https://www.colorfulwolf.com/blog/2023/06/12/why-im-going-back-to-chrome-after-six-months-of-firefox/">Firefox vs Chrome</a>: I&#8217;m still using both. On the desktop, behind the safety of a Pi Hole and several ad blocking extensions, I&#8217;ve completely switched back to Chrome and I love it. The UX just feels that tad bit sharper than Firefox. But on mobile, especially when I&#8217;m out of the house, Firefox is still my go-to browser. The lack of ad blockers in Chrome means that I frequently end up with three quarters of my tiny phone screen being filled with video ads and banner ads. That&#8217;s just terrible. Youtube has begun to disallow ad blockers on desktop, which is quite worrying in terms of setting a precedent. Enshittification is definitely a thing, and the internet we used to know is gone. If there is a place that preserves the freedom of the old internet I would love to know about it. Now&#8217;s the time to switch.</p>
