<p>When I was younger I knew with absolute certainty that I wanted to be cryogenically frozen when I died, so I could eventually live again, whenever science has evolved enough to resuscitate my icy cold head. Why wouldn&#8217;t I want to live forever? At the very least I could observe the world endlessly and see what happens. I think I felt a lot more special, important and unique back then. Now that I&#8217;m hitting middle age, I&#8217;m kind of ok with just fading into obscurity after I die. My contribution to the world will end when I die. All I want to do until then, is ensure that my contribution is a positive one. Exactly what that contribution is and how it will be judged, I still have no idea.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m definitely resonating with the &#8216;middle&#8217; in middle age lately. A lot of the goals I have are pass-me-ons from my younger self. I remember the enthusiasm I had for my goals back then, but nowadays.. it&#8217;s all just kind of faded away. I know that I have to do something with my goals before I hit old age. The reason for that is pretty simple: my family doesn&#8217;t age well. Looking at how others in my immediate family have aged, even if I do everything right, it&#8217;s pretty unlikely that I&#8217;ll have a good quality of life after 70, and personally I wouldn&#8217;t bet on my chances after 65 either. If I want to achieve things, it needs to be before then. It reminds me of the <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html">Your Life in Weeks</a> post by Wait But Why. We should spend our time wisely.</p>



<p>I always considered myself an Optimistic Nihilist. The nihilist part of that is: I believe that, ultimately, there is no real meaning behind anything, and when we die, that&#8217;s it. But the optimist part of that is: if all that&#8217;s true and nothing really matters, then we might as well enjoy ourselves while we can and live life to the fullest. This was my belief when I was young, and I believe that I still believe this now, although lately my applied beliefs are more in line with that of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_convergence">paperclip maximizer</a>. I exist to provide, and I provide to exist. I try to make money so I can exist longer. I try to keep my body somewhat healthy so I can exist longer. I don&#8217;t consider any of that a great life goal in and of itself, but, despite literally decades of thinking about this, it&#8217;s still the only answer I can give myself, and I&#8217;m in a privileged enough position to not have to worry about the simpler challenges in life, like being employed, fed and healthy, for which I am very grateful. For now though, all I&#8217;m doing is buying myself more time to think.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m still at the lower end of middle age. I have time. I don&#8217;t know what to do with that time yet. But I have time. There should be more.</p>
