<p>I don&#8217;t know how long it will take me to get over the death of my dad, but I know for sure that it&#8217;ll be a lot longer than the three months it&#8217;s been so far. And then my mom died. </p>



<p>Mom had struggled with lung cancer for the past few years. She&#8217;d done chemo and overcome it. But when she started feeling ill after dad died, it took the doctors a long time and a lot of scans to figure out that, while her lungs were still clean (well, minus all the COPD she also had), the cancer was now in her bones. From there, it went really quickly.</p>



<p>I have no fucking clue what else to write here. Life is miserable right now.</p>
