<p>I saw <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13238346/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_1_tt_7_nm_0_q_past%2520live">Past Lives</a> the other day. I don&#8217;t think it was the best of the oscar nominees, but it was the one that resonated with me the most. I too left a country to start a new life, twice. It takes a little time, but, after a while, it really does feel that the person I was in those past lives is just a completely different person. It affects the people you leave behind, but also my own life; every time I go back to one of the countries I used to live in, I can&#8217;t help but be reminded that that life is now gone forever. Depending on my state of mind, and which bits of the past I remember, that can either feel sad, or liberating.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m turning 40 this year. Insert clich√© here. Because my past lives were all very real breakpoints in life I think turning 40 doesn&#8217;t affect me as much as it might others. If I had lived only one life, I would have a lifetime worth of things I still want to accomplish by now. Instead, I have two past lives&#8217; worth of things that other versions of me wanted to accomplish, and I feel less emotionally attached to those things than I wish I would. I still want to cycle Japan, but it&#8217;s not a hobby that current-me would start. I still like going back to Holland, but I can definitely no longer call it my home.</p>



<p>I&#8217;d like to write a book. I&#8217;d like to build a computer game, from the ground up, by myself. I&#8217;d like to be at peace again, the way my past lives were. Despite having it better than ever, I&#8217;ve never worried as much as I do now. Though perhaps that&#8217;s finally starting to decrease a little. I don&#8217;t know if hitting 40, or other upcoming events in my life, will trigger a new life. For the moment at least, I want to make the most of my current life.</p>
