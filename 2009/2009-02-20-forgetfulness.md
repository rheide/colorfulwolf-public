I had been meaning to write a blogpost about forgetfulness, but I keep on forgetting. Today I bought bread, butter and ham, in order to make something that I just now found it is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strammer_Max" target="_blank">Strammer Max</a>, which I think is most possibly the worst name for a food dish ever. It's basically ham and a fried egg on bread. I forgot to buy the eggs. I bought plastic bags because I thought I didn't have any left, but it turns out I still had a lot. I also forgot to buy dishwashing detergent. Well done, me. Big spring cleanup... of my brain..
