I have long tried to keep an open mind about all things, China not in the least, because many of my friends here are/were Chinese. But China has a bad reputation that they're really doing nothing to fix. Just yesterday I watched the hugely controversial movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093170/" target="_blank">Men behind the Sun</a>, which 'discusses' quite a sensitive topic: Japan's squadron 731 which, during WW2, performed expirements on living humans and did all kinds of horrible things that you really do not even want to imagine, let alone see a movie about. But the Chinese made a movie about it, of course, with a healthy dose of propaganda and bad acting included, not to mention a real live cat that gets killed and real live rats that get burned alive. But that movie was mode twenty years ago, and of course China has changed since then.The main reason of this rant is something else entirely.

The real reason of the rant is this: <a href="http://www.sankakucomplex.com/2009/09/02/souls-window-china-rips-off-5cm-per-second/" target="_blank">"Soul's window"</a>. It's a Chinese anime that I have no idea what it's about, but you can find the trailer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKZjwDaly3g&amp;feature=related" target="_blank">here on youtube</a>. As you can see from the link, the Chinese kindly ripped every cell of animation from Makoto Shinkai's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Centimeters_Per_Second" target="_blank">Byousoku 5cm</a>. As you can hear from the youtube trailer they fucked up the voice acting though. I have to say that 5cm is one of my favorite anime of all time (I know it's cheesy, but I like that!) so seeing the Chinese butcher it in this way makes me pass judgment. No respect for China any more.

Principles, people! Start acting on them!
