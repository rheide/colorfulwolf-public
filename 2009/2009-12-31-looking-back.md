It's the last day of the year, so I guess it's time to look back on the past year and reflect. Actually, I spend a lot of my time reflecting. I guess it's kind of a hobby, and an unhealthy one at that. Well, here goes.

2009 sucked! I honestly believe that, considering all the years I've spent in Japan, 2009 is the worst year by far. Certainly, there were some highlights, the extreme being the Africa trip in May, which was absolutely brilliant and one of the best things I've ever done in my life. But besides Africa and the occasional day-trip my year pretty much sucked. I'm very happy to say that, because I realize it consciously, so I can do something about it. I can change my direction.

Despite the suckiness this year has been very important to me. It's the first time in a long time that I seriously considered my future options. While it's not 100% decided yet, I have big plans for 2010 that Â I'm very excited about. It's still too early to blog about it, but you can expect to hear about it in a month or so. Lastly, and this is perhaps the thing that affected me the most, I managed to reach closure with the two girls that were closest to me. Things didn't work out the way I wanted, but at least I can move on now. (&lt;/emo&gt;)

A new year! New people, new chances. And it can't possibly be worse than 2009 :D

Happy new year!
