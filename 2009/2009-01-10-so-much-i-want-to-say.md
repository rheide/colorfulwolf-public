But I lack the brainpower right now. It's 1AM and I'm sleepy. I want to talk about the Christmas trip back home, coming back to Japan, thoughts that are going through my mind, but I only feel like sleeping right now. This blog has been lacking content recently. I will try to add more later. 申し訳ございません！

This is a picture I took tonight. The moon light is so bright that mount Fuji and OoYama are clearly visible with the naked eye. Note the airplane in the top left part of the sky. It creates a funky light pattern when the camera is set to 30 seconds exposure.
