In the center you see two power socket converter plugs that will help me charge all the crap that I'm bringning to Africa. I'm planning to bring a GPS and an iPod, which I'll need to charge through USB, and a charger for my 50D, which is huge and heavy and annoying. I got no choice but to bring it, cause two batteries will not last me for two weeks..

Of course the most important thing in this picture is the yellow paper, which is the certificate that I'll need when I enter SA, so I can prove that I have been vaccinated against yellow fever. That's right, I am now officially Yellow Fever Certified. Ha! As if living in Japan was not proof enough...
