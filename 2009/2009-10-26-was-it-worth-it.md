The Windows 7 burger. 7 beef paddies. Only in Japan, only available for one week. Can't miss it. Just like an earthquake or some other natural disaster.

No. It wasn't worth it.

Sorry guys! No videos yet. I got a new camera last week (Canon S90) but I don't have video editing software for it yet. Chotto matte kudasai.

Really. It was disappointing. It started out fine, but after some bites it just became a huge, dense mass of gray matter, without any taste whatsoever. Except perhaps leather. That's all I can say. You won't see me at BK for quite some time from now..
