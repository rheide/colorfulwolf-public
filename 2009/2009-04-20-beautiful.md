Google Earth is the only reason why I still have faith in humanity. I was just browsing a bit, starting from Hokkaido, then to Sakhalan, then following the Amur river which is the border between Russia and China. There's so much cool stuff to see there! So much nature, empty paths, huge forests,Â small villages, abandoned train tracks and tiny train stations, but also a huge train with freight trains several kilometers long. I found a cool <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&amp;ll=49.626892,117.347031&amp;spn=0.050427,0.079651&amp;t=h&amp;z=14" target="_blank">border crossing</a> too. And the best part is: there's hundreds of pictures! Local people and tourists have taken care to document every part of their home town and province. On the one side I'm a bit disappointed that every bit of true nature's already been explored, catalogued, and put online for everyone to see, but on the other side I'm really happy to see that so many people share my hobby.
