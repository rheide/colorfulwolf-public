I just finished watching the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Way_Round" target="_blank">Long Way Round</a>, a great documentary of two motorcyclists driving from London to New York, all the way through Europe,Â Kazakhstan, Mongolia and Siberia. It's a truly epic and inspiring series that really makes you feel like you want to get out there and get some adventure for yourself :D I recommend this to anyone who's thinking about traveling somewhere.
