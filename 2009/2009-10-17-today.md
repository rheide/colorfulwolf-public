I cleaned my room today. After four years of living Japan I finally have a rice cooker. After the last intern left I had a chance to grab what I wanted, so I also got a new microwave, a vacuum cleaner and a nice cupboard for my books. I've been steadily throwing away all the stuff I don't need, but still my room is filling up. I've decided to stay here until there is a need to move. A single guy doesn't need much space, after all.

It's quite cold today.
