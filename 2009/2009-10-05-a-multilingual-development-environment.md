I've been cleaning up a bit at work, and I rediscovered a file with various quotes that the interns and I thought funny enough to log. I'll share some of them here, for nostalgias sake. I omitted the names and the countries cause I don't want to offend people. It's been a great couple of years, and there's a lot more quotes besides these, but these are the only ones that are quite context-free and devoid of vulgar language ;)

<b>On countries, language, culture and misunderstandings</b>
