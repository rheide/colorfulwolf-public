Ever since I've come back from my trip last month I've found it increasingly easy to make myself do things. It seems that I got a new sense of perspective after jumping off a cliff in Africa. I can convince myself to run 5 laps instead of 4, even though I am dead tired after the fourth one. I can convince myself to eat less, to go to work early, and to think about my future. Perspective is a wonderful thing. Too bad it disappears again over time. I'd better do something crazy within the next three months or else I'll lose it again :D
