For weeks or months now I have been operating in freeflow mode. That is: whenever I feel like doing something, I do it. Or, whenever I don't feel like doing something, I don't do it. That sounds like something that could go horribly wrong, but strangely enough things are going quite alright. I can't keep it up 100% of course. There's work, and there's meetings I need to schedule and prepare for that I don't want to do, but all in all the percentage of things in my life that I don't like is at an all-time low.

Example. I was cycling to somewhere. Suddenly I thought: I want to eat strawberries! So I turned around and cycled to the supermarket.

Ok, stupid example. And the supermarket didn't have strawberries either. But you see my point, I hope. If the thought enters your mind, it must be for a reason. So why not follow up on it. I could have thought: but I'm going home right now, I MUST go home. In a freeflow state there is no fixed 'mode' that your brain operates in. It can change instantly to something else. Kind of like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention-deficit_hyperactivity_disorder" target="_blank">ADD</a>, which is now called ADHD. Apparently ADD also stands for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADD" target="_blank">Asian Drinking Disorder</a>. Brilliant. Call it voluntary ADHD then. It's rather relaxing except for when I'm surfing wikipedia. I always seem to want to click on one more link before going to bed...
