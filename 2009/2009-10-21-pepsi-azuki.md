And on this lonesome night I ventured outside in search of some satisfaction for my ever rumbling stomach. Little did I know that this night would turn out to be so gruesome...

Pepsi <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_bean_paste" target="_blank">Azuki</a>. I am not surprised by the weirdness of this drink. I've seen all kinds of weird stuff in vending machines: hot coffee, instant pudding, you name it. What I'm surprised about is that renowned names like Pepsi and Coca Cola actually are joining in the mad craziness of putting random ingredients in their products and then selling it to unsuspecting customers like me. Despite the madness this Pepsi Azuki concoction is actually not that bad, and nowhere near as horrible as <a href="/blog/2009/06/24/goddamn-pepsi-shiso/" target="_blank">GODDAMN PEPSI SHISO</a>.
