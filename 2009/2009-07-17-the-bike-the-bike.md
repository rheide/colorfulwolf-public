Brought my bicycle to the store last Saturday. They told me they'd receive new parts on Tuesday and they'd call me and let me know the total price. Nope. Nothing on Tuesday, Went to the shop on Wednesday, but it was closed. Called on Thursday, nobody home. Finally they answered the phone today, and they told me they'll receive the parts tomorrow. Not great service I have to say. Well, at least it'll finally be fixed.
