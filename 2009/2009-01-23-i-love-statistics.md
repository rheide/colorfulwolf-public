As the title says, I love them. Especially when it comes to stuff I am interested in, like photography. I found this program called <a href="http://www.cpr.demon.nl/prog_plotf.html" target="_blank">ExposurePlot</a>, which analyses all your pictures' EXIF info and graphs properties like focal length, aperture and shutter times in very clear charts, that show you exactly how much you use each setting. Here's a picture of my stats:Â

Click to enlarge. This picture shows how many times I used each focal length, aperture, shutter speed and ISO. I usually shoot in P or Av mode, so the shutter speed is mostly determined by the camera. Cool stuff!

(thanks to sister's nagging I finally updated the <a href="/blog/photography/" target="_self">photography page</a> with my new stuff :D)
