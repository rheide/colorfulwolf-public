And it's almost the end of the tour too T_T. I'm just starting to love Africa, really. As it turns out we spent most of our time in South Africa at the Kruger National Park, and we only spent time in Botswana to get to Zambia, which is where we just arrived today. The place we're staying at is like a Disneyland for grown-ups, with all kinds of crazy activities, like skydiving, bungeejumping, abseiling, and a whole bunch of other things. We're set to do abseiling tomorrow, vic falls on Thursday, Canoe-ing on Friday, and possibly skydiving on Saturday, so it's going to be a nice couple of days :D

More later. Internet costs 300 Kwacha a minute here, which is a whopping 0.05USD. I'm catching a flight back to Japan on Monday, so when I'm back I'll post more. Or who knows, I might be somewhere completely different. Let's wait and see ;)
