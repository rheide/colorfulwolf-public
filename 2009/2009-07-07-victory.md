I haven't seen a single cockroach for more than a week now, nor have they been caught in the traps I set. I say 'they' but I really saw only one. I've left no food or water lying around in my room, and if it that single cockroach that I witnessed last week tried to get out of the crevice that it crawled into, it should get stuck in a trap immediately. I have a new hypothesis: two cockroaches snuck into my room at the same time last time, and only once. I killed one of them and the other one is out of my reach and either died there or will die soon. If I keep my balcony door and my front door sealed I should not receive any more unwelcome visitors.

I've been catching up on anime lately, watching EF, A tale of <a href="http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&amp;aid=5274" target="_blank">memories </a>and <a href="http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&amp;aid=6014" target="_blank">melodies</a>. It looked interesting at first, but after a while I figured out the 'theme' of the series and it got bored fast. It's like an art project that's overdone. Oh well. <a href="http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&amp;aid=6238" target="_blank">Higashi no Eden</a> finished recently, which is really too bad because it was the best anime I've seen in quite a while. And then there's <a href="http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&amp;aid=6176" target="_blank">Sora wo Kakeru Shoujo</a> which is quite possibly the most unimaginative piece of crap on TV this year.

Found this website while wiki-ing tonight: <a href="https://www.23andme.com/" target="_blank">https://www.23andme.com/</a>. For $399 they will map your genes for you and provide you with all the information you can possibly think of wanting. I think that's absolutely brilliant. It would certainly satisfy some of my thirst for new information and statistics. Hmmm...
