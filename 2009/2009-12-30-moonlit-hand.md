<blockquote>Go as a pilgrim and seek out danger far from the comfort and the well lit avenues of life.
Pit your every soul against the unknown and seek stimulation in the comfort of the brave.
Experience cold, hunger, heat and thirst and survive to see another challenge and another dawn.
Only then will you be at peace with yourself and be able to know and to say; I look down the farthest side of the mountain a fulfilled and understanding all, and truly content that I lived a full life and one that was my own choice.</blockquote>
