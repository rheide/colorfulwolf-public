A regular bento with a malaria pill. I took my first one on Tuesday. The doctor told me last Friday when I got my yellow fever shot that I might get sick this week, and the malaria medicin has a huge list of side effects which might cause me to feel ill, but somehow I've never felt better. I feel a lot more healthy than last week, when I was sniffing day and night. Interestingly the spot on my arm where I get the vaccination turned red and is kinda hard to the touch. I hope that goes away soon...

Preparation check: bought mushiyoke supuree--&gt; "spray that makes bugs avoid you". Yay. Now all that's left is a good big bag to put all my clothes and my sleeping bag in...
