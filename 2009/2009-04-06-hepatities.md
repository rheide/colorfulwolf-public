Got my second shot for Hepatitis A today. I didn't realize that I had to pay fecking 8400 yen again.. 

Started doing speech recognition on Android at work.  It's easier than I thought. 

Sometimes my brain works like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209144/" target="_blank">Memento</a>. I found a burrito in my fridge this morning and I don't remember how it got there. I think I am suffering from memory loss. 

I'm sleepy, so I"ll leave it at this. Here are some pictures of the sakura blossom in <a href="http://picasaweb.google.co.jp/rv7021/Otakumi#" target="_blank">Ikebukuro </a>and <a href="http://picasaweb.google.co.jp/rv7021/Yokohanami" target="_blank">Kanagawa</a>.
