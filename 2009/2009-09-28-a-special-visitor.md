Ah, the wonderful smell of rain after a period ofÂ drought. Even though most of the summer has passed already, tonight was enlightened by a fresh typical summer rain. One that is not too cold and not too violent. A peaceful shower. But the shower brought out something else besides rain to my fifth floor apartment. Something rather unusual.

And as the rain passes so do the interns. Tonight the last intern leaves the youth heim. Who would have thought that I would be the last one of the foreigners to live here..
