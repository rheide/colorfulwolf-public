To really enjoy the taste of water you must be dehydrated.

To really enjoy a good onsen you need to first exhaust yourself.

To really enjoy a good sleep you need to be very sleepy.

To really enjoy your self-time you need to really enjoy your people-time.

One cannot live without the other. You can't enjoy the downhill if you don't go uphill first. Try to enjoy the bad parts of life, because they will help you appreciate the good parts even more.
