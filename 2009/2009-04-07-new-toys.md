New iPod Classic 120G and a new 1.5TB hard drive. How enjoyable.

Whoops! Almost forgot to mention how annoying the iTunes software is. First I have to download a new version, because the iPod comes with no software at all, then during installation it kindly asks me if I would rather use the bastard crappy iTunes shit instead of my own nice player for all audio files, and then I have to tell Apple that I don't want to register every I time I start the damn program. Well done, Apple. So much for the user experience..

(That being said, many words of praise for the hardware. iPods are wonderful. )
