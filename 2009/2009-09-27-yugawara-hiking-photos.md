So here's the edited pictures of last week's hike in Yugawara. It's getting increasingly harder for me to find nearby places that I haven't been to before. Yugawara was in interesting choice, as it's right at the start of the Izu peninsula. There's not much room between ocean and mountains, which made for an interesting (and very steep) climb.

A friend introduced me to a new program to stitch panoramic photos, and this occasion was the perfect opportunity to give it a try. It's called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugin_(software)" target="_blank">hugin</a>, and so far I have to say it works way better than the crappy Canon photostitch software I was using up until now. You can see two of the panoramas I took in this post, and the remaining pictures are on <a href="http://picasaweb.google.co.jp/mrhazard/YugawaraHiking#" target="_blank">Picasa</a>, as usual.
