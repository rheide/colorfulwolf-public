Today I cycled to some places I don't usually go to, and I managed to take some nice pictures. The weather was good and my bicycle was willing, so I managed to climb the mountain and make it down to the beach in time for sunset. Great day for cycling! Here are the pictures:

Alas... In reality my bicycle is still broken and the weather <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cfwblog/uploads/2009/01/bp_img_5106.jpg" target="_blank">sucked</a> today, so I stayed at home. Better luck next time! :D
