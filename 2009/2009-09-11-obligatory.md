My neighbor is back. The cockroach is back too. I wonder if there's a connection..

On an unrelated note, it's happened to me four times in the last week that I was surfing wikipedia for some random thing, clicking on links, and ended up on this page: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_death" target="_blank">Ego Death</a>. It's almost like a compass that's becoming more and more consistent..
