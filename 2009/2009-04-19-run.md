So I finally took up running. As usual, it's something that I wanted to start a long time ago, but I've been too lazy to really start. Fortunately I'm not the only one who wants to do some exercise, and running together creates just enough pressure for me to actually do it. Last Friday was the first time I went, and it took me 10m11s to finish one lap (yes, I suck...). Today I did it in 9m36s, mostly thanks to Boris with whom I tried to keep up during the first part of the lap (1.5km). Oh well, at least there's progress.

Side note: is anybody following the <a href="http://trial.thepiratebay.org/" target="_blank">spectrial </a>against <a href="http://thepiratebay.org/" target="_blank">The Pirate Bay</a>? I'm following it with great interest. I was thinking of writing a post about why TPB should win this trial, and how the entire world will plunge into darkness if the evil corporate movie company bastard dogs win, but I can't quite find the words... Maybe next time. For now, what do you think about this?
