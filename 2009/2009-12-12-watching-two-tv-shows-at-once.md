I'm currently watching an anime that's mildly interesting, but it's very slow-paced. I'm enjoying watching it, but I'm usually surfing the net on the side. I wonder if it would be possible to watch two tv shows at once. While we're at it, how about watching two tv shows at once while surfing the net? 300% efficient at doing useless things! :D
