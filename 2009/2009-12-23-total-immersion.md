I watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0499549/" target="_blank">Avatar</a>. Not knowing at all what it  was about prior to watching the movie, I was completely blown away. It's been a very very long time since I felt so completely immersed in a movie. Watching it in 3D with funky glasses helped, of course. It really felt like I was right there, in the middle of it. It made me completely forget about anything negative about the movie, and I only remember the good parts. 3D is incredible. I feel an urgent need to get a 3D home theater setup somehow :D
