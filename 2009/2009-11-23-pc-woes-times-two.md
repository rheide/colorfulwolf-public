Right, so yesterday my PC would no longer boot up, today one of my external hard drives dies. Just great. Fortunately the disk did not contain anything important (such as my photos :O). I didn't have a backup, but I do run a program every day that lists all the files on the disk, so I can figure out what it is exactly that I'd lost. It would be rather nice of the fairy diskmother if she would let me have my files back...
