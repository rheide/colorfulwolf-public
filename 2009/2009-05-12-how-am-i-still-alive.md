This is me jumping off a cliff:

Here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc6b1DfxW5s&amp;feature=related" target="_blank">video </a>of someone else doing the same thing we did. The backwards jump was amazing. I still see the cliffs rising away from me every time I close my eyes!

I'm in Malaysia right now. Waiting 18 hours for my flight back to Japan. Internet, books, and wandering around are my main forms of entertainment. Can't wait to be back home. I've been on the way back since Sunday.
