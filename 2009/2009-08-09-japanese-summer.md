Isn't it annoying when the camera does not record what the eye sees? No matter how much you try to adjust the camera while taking the shot, or afterwards the picture in Photoshop, sometimes is just won't become that what you've seen with your own eyes. I guess this is what separates the true professionals from amateurs like me :)

And before I forget, I want to mention this: the best way to spend a Japanese summer is inside in an air-conditioned room!
