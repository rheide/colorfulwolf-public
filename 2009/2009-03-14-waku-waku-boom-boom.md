Here's some HDR pics of today. As you can probably see from the images I gave up on Photoshop and I'm now using Photomatix' HDR for idiots functions. They fit me a lot better!

Cleaned my room today. I threw out a lot of stuff I didn't need, including a lot of food that had expired, some items even years ago... &gt;_&lt;; Â Oh well, it feels a lot better now that I've cleaned that up. Not owning a lot is fun! I keep thinking about what else I can throw away :D
