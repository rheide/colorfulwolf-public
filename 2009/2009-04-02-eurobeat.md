Ok, so I'm known to listen to some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurobeat" target="_blank">dodgy music</a>... but sometimes even I cannot help but burst out in laughter at some of the titles. Here's some Eurobeat artists and song names for your enjoyment:
<ul>
	<li>Jeff Driller: Take My Hammer</li>
	<li>Jeff Driller: Rocket in my Pocket</li>
	<li>Billy the Butcher: Cannibal Attraction</li>
	<li>Hi-Gang: Eeh Ooh! Eeh Ooh! Eeh Ooh!</li>
	<li>Lady Energy: Sex Kamikaze Girl</li>
	<li>Jee Bee: Every Time You Touch Me There</li>
	<li>Joe Banana</li>
	<li>Franz Mad Cow Tornado: Suck a Bazooka</li>
</ul>
Ah, those wacky Japanese. The lyrics are even worse... :D
