Strongest one I've felt since I've been in Japan! Or at least the strongest one I've ever felt while on the fifth floor o_0. This time I was actually worried enough to walk down the five stairs while the earthquake was going on. I was the only one, of course. All the Japanese people stayed inside...

Also, there are<a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=earthquake" target="_blank"> more people</a> who somehow feel a need to share this information with everyone immediately..
