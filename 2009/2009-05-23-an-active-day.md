Went cycling today with Tim and Nicola. It turned out to be a full-day trip which took us from the mountainside to the sea. We found a nice local ramen place in Hiratsuka and went go-karting for no predetermined reason at all, which was great :D

More pics later. For now, here's the route. 40km's worth of cycling (in actuality I think it's more like 42 kms).

Thanks to Nicola for the pictures while Tim and I were driving. A lot of them turned out great, but I feel stupid because I didn't set up the camera correctly before driving...

These days it's starting to get quite hot and humid. Despite that, I would rather keep my balcony door closed and sweat like a pig  than smell my neighbor's smoke.
