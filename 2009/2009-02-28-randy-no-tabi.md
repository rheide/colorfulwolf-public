I went to Izu today. Enjoyed the scenery in the train for 3 hours going there, 3 hours going back. It was a great day in terms of weather. I'd love to share more, but I'm tired, so maybe later. For now, here's three HDR pics I've managed to put together tonight. It's quite troublesome if the source pictures aren't perfectly aligned, because Photoshop creates weird bubble-like areas that look very ugly. I set my camera to high-speed mode and bracketed between 1 and 2 EV's to each side. It works beautifully, and any imperfections in the end result occured purely because of my suckage at Photoshop. I think I'm getting the hang of it though...

The combined 32 bit RAW file of each of these images is a 180 megabyte .psd file :'(
