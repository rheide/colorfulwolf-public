It might not seem like I am living a very luxurious life; I don't have a car, I'm not filthy rich and my room couldn't possibly be much smaller than it is now. Still, I am living life in my own luxurious way, especially the last couple of weeks. I guess it all depends on how one defines 'luxury'. 

For me, luxury means doing what I want to do, whenever I want it. Eating what I want to eat, whenever I want it. Sleeping when I want to sleep, etc. etc. Luxury doesn't have to be expensive. Even though my current lifestyle is not very luxurious in terms on money I spend every day, it still feels luxurious to me, because it's all I really want. I'm living the luxurious life. And that's bad. 

Why is that bad? For one thing, because I am allowing myself to indulge too much in things that are not really important. I am enjoying the luxury of having hours and hours of movies and shows at my disposal, but instead I really should (could?) be looking for a new apartment or a new job. Eating and sleeping whenever I want means I am not in very good shape right now. Sleeping in every morning means I don't cycle to the beach anymore. 

When you take a photo, do you want the colors to look bland? No, I don't think so. A good photo will have sparkling, vivid colors that speak to you. But if you over-saturate the picture it will look fake and unreal. Having too much luxury in life feels the same way. It's like you're not really living life, you're only enjoying it. That sounds a bit strange, but I'm not the only one who feels this way. I got confirmation of this feeling from the strangest source: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0910970/" target="_blank">Wall-E</a>. Yup, that movie is essentially about what happens to people when their lives get easier and easier. That future does not seem very good at all, does it?

So here's my statement: any person who is living a life of total luxury is not truly happy. What do you think?
