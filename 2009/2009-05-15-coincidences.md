Do you believe in coincidences? I've had a really weird one just yesterday. Two days ago I called my parents to tell them I arrived safely back in Japan, and then my mom told me that my cousin was getting married. Yesterday I had to call my bank in Holland to ask them about my creditcard, and guess who I got connected with? My cousin! How freaky is that?? And when I called my parents to tell them about this freaky incident they already knew. News travels so fast these days :D

Anyway, congratulations Tamara and Herman! Wish you all the best!
