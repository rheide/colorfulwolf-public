The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Ultra_Deep_Field" target="_blank">Hubble Ultra Deep Field</a> is the name of a small region of space that the Hubble telescope observed. I thought I'd just mention the awesomeness of this endeavour here. The result of the observation is an image that looks too fantastic and science-fiction-like to even appear in Star Trek, yet it's real.  The HUDF is awesome because of two reasons. First, because it shows in great clarity how utterly insignificant we humans are. And second, because it shows, despite our insignificance, how far we've come that we're able to accomplish a thing like this.

Yay human race. Now get a move on and start colonizing other planets.
