It's done! The ticket's been booked. Now I still need to see if I can get the vaccinations and the visas in time, but if all goes as planned I'll be in South Africa with Kamil one month from now. Craziness!

My new boss made fun of me today at the meeting.. :O I heard last week that I was going to get a new boss, and I asked him for holidays yesterday. Today we had a meeting and my boss was kind of enough to mention that his first official act in dealing with me was to grant me my holidays, which gave everyone in the meeting a good laugh :D Well, respect to you, Miyazaki-san, and thanks a lot!

So... anybody interested in joining? :D
