My schedule for today: wait, fly, wait, fly. It's kind of boring, but I'm okay with that, considering what's planned for next week. Traveling through South Africa and Botswana to end up at Victoria Falls in Zambia. I'm starting to realize that I'm actually going to Africa. I've also realized that my stomach still hurts.. Must be the curry. Or the malaria pills. Meh.

I doubt that there are many opportunities to access the internet during our trip, but at least Johannesburg and Livingstone should provide some internet access. I'll try to keep track of what I did so I can share it with you guys later :D
