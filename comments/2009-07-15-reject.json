Social news sites such as Digg, Reddit, Hacker News, etc. can give you an idea of what's \"popular,\" which may bring you closer to your goal of \"useFull.\" Of course, for the best results, don't rely on others - if you want something done right, you'll have to do it yourself. Luckily, with a PC and a good bot, \"you\" can be searching 24/7 for relevant content.<br/><br/>My recommendation: revisit searchlores.org and dive deeper and deeper into the Perl/PHP/Python search bots. Try to bend them to your will and see what they turn up. You can auto-generate your own \"personal news site!\"<br/><br/>Best wishes from China ;)"}]}
