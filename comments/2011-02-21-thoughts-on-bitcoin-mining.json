Block generation is how the network verifies transactions, and getting 50 BTC per block (for now) is only a nice bonus for maintaining the network. The difficulty system aims to limit block generation to one every 10 minutes on average, so the entire network has time to agree on which block is the latest."}, {"author": "Xi", "date": "2011-02-22 01:14:11", "content": "Sorry, feel asleep after the first few paragraphs.

If a bunch of people leave the mining population, the difficulty level will be adjusted downwards to keep the Bitcoin block generation rate at one block every 10 minutes.<br/><br/>This would happen if the market price of Bitcoins drops below what would be profitable at a given difficulty level. This would also happen when the payout per block drops from 50 to 25 (which will happen at block 210001)."}, {"author": "Bob", "date": "2011-05-26 02:56:47", "content": "Don't bother with bitcoin.

Besides, they used and paid for their electricity. The problem is the control exerted by the pool operators.<br/><br/>It is easy to see how enormously the pool operators profit. They claim the fee of 2-3% (which translates to 1-1.5 BTC) is required to maintain the pool. However, a simple calculation reveals a single operator of a major pool makes hundreds or thousands of dollars' worth of bitcoins daily by maintaining it. One does not need these kinds of amounts of money to maintain a server or even a dozen.<br/><br/>The thing is, I am perfectly fine with this. Everyone is a voluntary participant and is able to track his/her profits (or usually lack thereof) virtually in realtime. Besides, what people are contributing here is some computation time, getting big electricity bills. Compared to the massive Ponzi schemes where people lose their lifetime savings and their houses this is just another nice little game on the Internet for most. One doesn't really lose anything of substance even though he might not (and most likely will not) profit from mining, be it pooled or solo.<br/><br/>We still shouldn't delude ourselves by thinking that this doesn't follow the same path as any \"money for free\" scheme: the early bird gets the worm\u0323 (gets the easiest bitcoins and ends up having the most of them). Additionally, as in any scheme seen so far, the ones early in the game get to use the others to further increase their profits, usually maintaining a faster rate of profit than any of the people who entered the game later. We are already past the point when this starts happening and we can easily observe it happening right now thanks to the extensive market data and statistics. It can't be stopped. It is just the nature of this beast."}, {"author": "Justin", "date": "2011-06-11 13:38:21", "content": "The good news is that federal governments will just let this continue no problem..."}, {"author": "john smith", "date": "2011-06-14 10:35:50", "content": "the guy that made 40K....bad luck on missing out on another 40K by waiting a week lol"}, {"author": "Miner", "date": "2011-06-16 16:23:33", "content": "I just put together a new site to help beginners start mining Bitcoins.
