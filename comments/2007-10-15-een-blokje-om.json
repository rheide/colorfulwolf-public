We call them \"d\u00e9panneur\" (litt. a \"helper-in-your-daily-life\"). However you cannot pay bills or buy tickets at the d\u00e9panneur :P<br/>The train system goes also with the need...

With no exhaust fumes or smog (not as much as in japan). when you want to be in a place where there are no sounds around you, in japan you really have too look hard. Holland is more peacefully then any other country. And all the people in japan(there are just too much). In holland when you get in a train, most of the times you can sit!<br/>So holland has his positive things. My englisch sucks because it's a long time ago for me, typing english. Excuse me for that. <br/><br/>Randy i don't know when you're anneversary is, so congratulations for you're 2 year stay in japan. <br/><br/>you're little sister."}, {"author": "Randy", "date": "2007-10-20 02:42:00", "content": "Haha, dank u :) Ik bel binnenkort nog wel ff.
