Back when I was in school and still living with my parents, they used to worry about the amount of time I would take for a shower - easily 30 minutes, sometimes 45.<br/><br/>This wasn't because it was naked sexy fun time, but because it was the only place I could truly be alone and without any expectation of interruption. For contrast, being at home alone isn't true solitude because you could be interrupted by a telephone call or unexpected visitor. Yet in a shower, I can free your mind from these possibilities as well and just focus on what's really important to me.<br/><br/>It's those thoughts that are constantly bouncing around in our heads, but that we never have the time for because we're being constantly interrupted and distracted by the kaleidoscope world all around us. <br/><br/>You know, the important ones ;)"}]}
