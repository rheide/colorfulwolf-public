I guess the ones from, say, Nigeria, are a bit easier to bribe than the ones in the UK."}, {"author": "Zai", "date": "2011-07-31 19:48:20", "content": "They do ask for a name and MTCN (money transfer control number), but yeah, the places that accept WU aren't necessarily careful about verifying this stuff.  They're not generally WU employees, though, they're whatever random convenience store clerks work at a WU-affiliate.  Does WU even run their own stores?  I've used them, but always have to go to a gas station or whatever.<br/><br/>Anyhow, giving someone the MTCN is pretty much equivalent to giving someone the cash."}]}
