For a good photographer, you can make the dullest moment most magical. At the same time, it can capture moments you would never have caught just by being there. Most people think that because you are behind the view finder most of the time you cannot truly enjoy the moment. But I beg to differ because to be able to make a good photograph, you need to be connected with the moment, be able to capture with it more than what is physically happening - and that is what makes a photographer good.
