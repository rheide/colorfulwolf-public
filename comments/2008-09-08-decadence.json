Wear it outside and your pretty much asking for trouble.. duh!!  And I LOVE digital watch's.. I dunno why! Yea, I can tell time, but I LOVE them anyway!! Maybe in a hurry and I just like too look at it.. I dunno!!  But, your right on the money on this one!!

That is pretty much the same. That is also why analog is way more handsome than a digital. I went to Geneva this weekend, and I really like the feeling to see the time running in all the gears of watches.<br/>I heard that in Japan, when you ask a girl to marry and offer her a ring, she has to buy you back a luxury watch, that is pretty cool :p"}, {"author": "Randy", "date": "2008-09-17 13:36:21", "content": "Well, leave it to the French to appreciate fashion articles ;)<br/><br/>You didn't quite get my point, though. I'm not arguing against buying earrings or necklaces. I'm arguing against spending 100 times more money on a brand necklace that looks the same as any other necklace. It's just not my thing, I guess.<br/><br/>Also, I think girls are prettier au naturelle :P"}]}
