I think the idea to simulate socialism and capitalism is too big a problem to attempt.  You'll need to make way too many underlying assumptions to make the comparison any meaningful.  But I think maybe if you ran simulations on specific areas of economies... maybe it'll be feasible.<br/><br/>If you are really interested in this, I suggest you have a read at a paper my friend published a while back about the development of countries.  http://chidalgo.com/Papers/HidalgoKlingerBarabasiHausmannScience2007.pdf<br/><br/>He didn't run any simulations but rather analyzed large quantities of data using complex networks."}]}
