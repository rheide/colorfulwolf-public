Are you in Kitakyushu now or where is the hostel? You could visit Dazaifu for one day, if you don't want to go to Fukuoka directly, it's located in south east of Fukuoka, or you can take the seaside road to Fukuoka and check Kokura castle and some other spots before. Ah, do what you want...it'll be perfect. When I came there last time in March I made some one-day-trips by car. But by bicycle it may be a little bit more difficult to change routes or anything...<br/>Have fun and enjoy beautiful Kyushu!"}, {"author": "rheide", "date": "2010-05-09 09:15:51", "content": "Dazaifu noted! I'm not sure if I'll pass by there. It depends a bit on the weather: if it's going to stay almost-rainy like this I might choose a safer route. Otherwise I'll go along the coast until I get to Nagasaki :D"}]}
