We felt we were good at programming, but we lacked confidence in our ability to do a mysterious, undifferentiated thing we called \"business.\" In fact there is no such thing as \"business.\" There's selling, promotion, figuring out what people want, deciding how much to charge, customer support, paying your bills, getting customers to pay you, getting incorporated, raising money, and so on. And the combination is not as hard as it seems, because some tasks (like raising money and getting incorporated) are an O(1) pain in the ass, whether you're big or small, and others (like selling and promotion) depend more on energy and imagination than any kind of special training.</i><br/><br/>Damn..
