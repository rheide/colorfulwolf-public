Note that you will probably have to host it somewhere to get it to work. When I tried it on Windows the applet wouldn't load the required jar files, even if they were placed in the same folder as the html file. Since the webcam component is a Swing component you can just add it to a JFrame and use that for testing."}, {"author": "Jeffry", "date": "2011-08-23 13:37:06", "content": "Hi, could you also provide tutorial to run it on desktop ?
