My wife and I are planning on a bike tour of Shikoku in Spring 09, so I'm looking forward to hearing more about your trip there when it happens.<br/><br/>I'm an ex-pat Aussie now living in the US, and if you have any questions about Australia, let me know. I haven't lived there for many years, but I've been back regularly. I'll be glad to offer any info I can. Good Luck!"}]}
