When I sent away my stuffs, they told me the box maybe destroy if we use furry and they confirmed me if that's ok. They also told me to buy insurance if I want. They also told me to put price in case of the stuffs are destroy. They also recommended me to use EMS because that's the most safest way.Actually she just want to help you and give you the best service as she can. There is nothing wrong with that. It's better to know information in advance than afterwards.<br/>I love the civilization of Japan!!!"}, {"author": "Kamil", "date": "2010-06-08 10:08:21", "content": "How come when I sent back the stuff they didn't ask anything, they only charged me 10,000 yen for the box.

Basically that's a safety measure so people don't buy stuff for cheap dollars in US and bypass 30% value added tax and stuff. But then German law says that if you have lived abroad for more than a year all the stuff you bring back is considered your daily life stuff and not a shopping spree and you don't have to pay any taxes.<br/><br/>Fingers crossed for your stuff to pass Somalia."}]}
