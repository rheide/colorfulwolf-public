The fees are about 10% of whatever you send, though, so it's really expensive and not something you should do regularly.  US Mail is a lot less expensive provided you don't have problems with mail theft."}, {"author": "megan", "date": "2011-07-31 20:09:43", "content": "I used craigs list to sell my droid x.  The person said she'd give me an extra $100 to ship it to Nigeria..I should have known.  She said she wanted to use pay pal and that I would have to ship it before the payment would transfer.  I sent the routing numbers and she sent me a fake \"pay pal\" your money is secure email.  I called pay pal after it had been 48 hrs and they told me it wasn't really them who'd sent the email.  Once I read it aloud I knew, because there were errors in spelling and grammer.  I called the post office and went down to fill out a recall form but unless I get it back tomorrow, it was too late.  It left the US 10 minutes before the recall was faxed.  It cost me only $32 to ship but the phone and accessories were well worth $250+ that I don't believe I'll be getting back!!! I filed a report with the FTC and the local police.  I have all the information including the cell phone number the buyer used to text with me.  She said she was \"deaf\" so I couldn't really call.  All the signs were there I wish I would have seen them!!"}, {"author": "mr x", "date": "2011-07-31 20:24:17", "content": "@megan you are really dumb."}, {"author": "GW", "date": "2011-07-31 20:45:47", "content": "@ mr x<br/><br/>And you're an asshole.<br/><br/>@ article<br/><br/>I'm unpleasantly surprised at how the scammers are changing tactics."}, {"author": "lol", "date": "2011-07-31 21:20:34", "content": "Not to sound like an asshole, but @megan is really dumb.<br/><br/>A fool and his money are soon parted."}, {"author": "dmk", "date": "2011-08-01 01:15:38", "content": "OMG @megan, I had a similar experience!
