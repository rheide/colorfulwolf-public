As for the lenses, I would not mind bringing the primes, unless you want to do a lot of portraits. If you intend mostly on taking landscapes, city shots and such a 18-50 or equavalent would do the trick.<br/>I have a 18-55, a 50-135(2.8) and a fast 50. The 50 is useless. The 50-135 was usefull in a couple of occasion, but it's a lot of weight and I could do without it.<br/>But if you want to take pictures of animals during safaris (who knows! :-) than a long lense may be necessary.<br/>Or maybe just the 18-200. Or just the 10-20 and a 50-200 (or any long lens you have).<br/>This was my 2mm (really bad joke...)"}, {"author": "rheide", "date": "2009-04-26 03:28:12", "content": "Thanks Alex! The best two lenses I have are the 10-22mm and the 70-300mm IS, and I was actually thinking of bringing a lightweight prime instead of the 18-200mm, because the 18-200 is rather large and the image quality is not that good. I'm kind of thinking I should bring a 28mm or 50mm prime for night shots.... Argh, maybe I'll just carry it all..."}, {"author": "Alex", "date": "2009-04-26 03:39:50", "content": "I would definitely bring the 10-22 and the 70-300 (for animals). Then maybe the 50 would make sense to fill the gap. But the question is: Do you really take pictures at that focal length?<br/>The 28 is useless, trust me. And dish the 18-200 too."}]}
