Japan is the only place enamored with Holland. Have you been to Holland, Michigan where they have a real Dutch windmill that was brought from Holland and re-constructed, surrounded by 150,000 tulips. The mill is operated by a woman who sent to Holland to study and be certified as an official, Dutch miller.
