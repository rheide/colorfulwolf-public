It could be drastically simplified to: \"build it and they will come ...and buy.\" When I look back at the lines you wrote <cite>I was doing something that people I knew depended on. By doing my job I could make their lives better.</cite>, I feel you'd be able to say the same if the company was yours (assuming your company isn't manufacturing lead-based pacifiers). It's all about identifying <b>what</b> you want to build, then delivering.<br/><br/>The only major difference is that as the <i>fearless oni leader</i> of the company, you are actually able to decide <b>what</b>. Your typical salaryman may build, but may not decide."}]}
