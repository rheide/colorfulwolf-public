But then I lost you at the last paragraph. In my way of thinking, the only way out is to start a small farm, grow your own produce, raise cows, chickens, get into composting and upcycling old furniture..seriously, this does sound quite appealing to me. Your solution is to digitize the human brain and take advantage of the digital resources rather than natural ones.<br/><br/>Now I am wondering what you mean by \"digitizing the human brain\"? Just curious. And as for digital resources - you can't very well eat memory bytes or heat and power your home with pixels...Digital resources to me seem great in terms of information, but to be used as raw materials instead of, say, vegetables or natural gas?<br/><br/>Would be interested to know your thoughts on this..."}, {"author": "slowvelder", "date": "2010-05-14 16:15:50", "content": "Lovely post that rings so true to me.  If you havent looked at it already, take a look at The Story of Stuff - its a short documentary on the net.  I think you may enjoy it.<br/>I will be back to follow your travels - good luck and ride safely!"}, {"author": "rheide", "date": "2010-05-15 04:32:20", "content": "Hi interpretartistmama. With digitizing the human brain, I mean transferring all our senses to the digital world, basically discarding our biological bodies. If we can do that, then it is possible to eat memory bytes ;) A virtual sense of a full stomach would take in just as much space (byte-wise) as a virtual sense of an empty stomach. In other words: free food!"}]}
