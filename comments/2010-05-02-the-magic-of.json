Ever since I got a taste of road tripping during my freshman year of college, I always come back to the inclination of biking around the US. Looking back on whenever I want to do this, it's always when I want to/need to get away from an issue that's bothering me ie. a terrible job, dissatisfactory relationship, etc. just to think things out. I envy that you do more than just think, but actually are doing it.<br/><br/>I hope by the end of this journey that you end up finding the answer you're looking for. I truly do."}]}
