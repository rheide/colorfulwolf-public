It's one of the main roads that runs through Fukuoka. You'll have to cycle 10-15km's to get out of the urban area though.."}, {"author": "Tim", "date": "2010-06-01 10:18:00", "content": "You should take a ferry from Fukuoka to Tsushima.  There is good cycling out there."}, {"author": "ivan", "date": "2010-06-03 13:08:15", "content": "actually i started to enjoy Fukuoka a bit during my short stay there.  I like the ACROS building they have there which is the concept of a mountain but is a building, at Tenjin park.  Nakasu was interesting.. unfortunately I am not setup here on a decent bike otherwise I would be doing what you guys are doing.  one thing for sure though, Fukuoka is a lot more beautiful than Osaka! I can't wait to leave here and get out to the country tomorrow."}]}
