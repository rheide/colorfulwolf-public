Do not let other people choose how you should be your life, because you probably do not have the same goals to achieve than them. Has I like to say, \"Everyday, you can choose to make your life the way you want it to be\", so stop complain, positive life is way more fun!<br/><br/>I hope you a relly good 2009 year!<br/><br/>Thank you for handing me NN for few days, too bad you could not do it. Next time ;-)"}, {"author": "rheide", "date": "2009-01-13 10:42:04", "content": "Matt, thx for the kind words! I'm sure we will meet again some time. Positive life kicks ass :D"}]}
