I think it's great that you've shed this old life in search of something new, even if you don't know exactly what it is you're looking for. To me, simply having time to relax and think is the ultimate luxury, even if you have to bike and camp the wilderness to achieve it. You're headed towards a fascinating freedom that few people will ever experience.<br/><br/>Have fun, friend!"}]}
