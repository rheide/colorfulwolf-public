I think qubital (?) stands a chance at holding up a human intellect without forcing it into pure logical modes (1s and 0s). Then that is so blisteringly new (quantum computing) it changes the scope of things -- ie: how much will processor time cost the uploaded intellect when 'time to think' is in demand?<br/><br/>Food for thought, get it while it's free!"}, {"author": "rheide", "date": "2010-07-16 14:11:43", "content": "Nice comment. I didn't want to go too far into implementation details here, just wanted to distinguish between the real world and a world where all that we can do is only limited by processor time. TBH I think it would even be possible with pure logical modes, just slower."}]}
