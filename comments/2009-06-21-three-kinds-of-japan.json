Got my own blog of life in Japan.<br/><br/>I know the work Japan very well.  I rarely see the gaijin Japan.  But I do occasionally see the fairytale Japan."}, {"author": "b", "date": "2009-06-22 03:45:43", "content": "Ah, it's a wonderful distinction to draw - great photo choices as well. With tourists, ignorance is bliss. They are able to visit a place and see it in a new, fascinating light, but never stick around long enough to appreciate the bullshit. Is one better than the other?<br/><br/>Time to get out of my computer chair and go explore more of China :)"}, {"author": "shanna", "date": "2009-06-22 09:32:35", "content": "daag...<br/>wat ik me af vroeg..je hebt het over ghibli..is er alweer een goede nieuwe film uitgekomen die ik nog nie ken??"}, {"author": "rheide", "date": "2009-06-22 10:00:10", "content": "Nah, niet echt.

I would add at least a forth category--the Japan that people who essentially live in both worlds (somewhat Japanized gaijin like myself, for example) are capable of experiencing.
