Do you agree?<br/><br/>Also, as more ASIC's and GPU miners get on the network, transactions should move quicker right? Also, are miners incentivized to encourage more commerce using bitcoins, because that will eventually lead to more blocks being processed? <br/><br/>Thanks,<br/><br/>Mike"}, {"author": "randy", "date": "2013-04-04 10:37:55", "content": "Ten years is a long time in tech. By your reasoning pretty much anyone who holds bitcoins now will be rich. I'm not willing to go that far in my predictions. The major thing holding Bitcoin back now is its volatility and that it's linked to other currencies to be usable."}]}
