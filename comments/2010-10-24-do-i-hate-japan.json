I think I'd rather stick pins in my eyes if I had to move back to Kuala Lumpur. Too sweaty, sticky and smelly. However, I do miss ice katchung and cendol. Mmm... E numbers and snotty, leechy looking things."}, {"author": "Xi", "date": "2010-10-24 01:53:50", "content": "I don't hate Malaysia, I'd jut rather avoid when possible!"}, {"author": "Kamil", "date": "2010-10-24 22:33:16", "content": "I thought you said you'll stop blogging...I will find Hong Kong too pressurising to live in. I'm sure if I wasn't from there, Hong Kong would be a brilliant place. I like Japan as it reminds me of Hong Kong before all the pollution. I would never go back to Japan for good, its too soul-less for me. I will continue to move to new places in search for my home. London is very close to it, but I know it won't be for long."}, {"author": "Slowvelder", "date": "2010-10-27 08:36:44", "content": "When I left Africa to live in Europe I was glad to be getting away.  After three years living and working in Europe I chose to return to one of the most beautiful countries in the world - my home - South Africa.  I really enjoyed my experience as an expat, loved Europe, but my greatest lesson was learning to love my home country and appreciating all we have here."}, {"author": "Kamil", "date": "2010-10-27 16:43:52", "content": "@Slowvelder: Yes, I agree with you that South Africa is a great country!

The only place I can picture myself relocating to is Stockholm, but I don't know why."}]}
