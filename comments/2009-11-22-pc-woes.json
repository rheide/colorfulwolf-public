It was a convertible one meaning that it looks like a laptop but the screen is a touch screen and it can be flipped to cover the keyboard. This is very useful to watch a movie or to draw. It was running Windows 7 which has very nice features related to the touch screen. Especially the media center was very nice. For example, you can use gestures to browse your media collection."}]}
