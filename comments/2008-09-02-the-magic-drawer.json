My husband and I have rented just a SMALL little Storage place REAL small enough for a couple of those plastic tub's you can buy at the Store,  And I have Photo's (plus my Photo's are on Cd's) but that too will change when Computer's change.. But we stick EVERYTHING we might want to look at when the GREAT Nephew's and GREAT Niece's get alittle bigger and can really appreciate it.. I see NO problem in keeping Memories, if there nice and neat... It could become a REALLY big problem if you don't watch it.. I ONLY save item's that OUR Family might enjoy later when the kid's get bigger... til l8er"}, {"author": "shanna", "date": "2008-09-03 12:35:23", "content": "Heey waarom doe je die dingetjes niet in een plakboek.
