I think once you realised that something you have had all along and is happy with it, you will no longer try to find something which is not there.<br /><br />Take it easy...you burnt the catalyst, not sure if you need it anymore, but what you have to realised is not that the catalyst has been burnt but what has not been burnt and make sure that it does not get burnt.<br /><br />Don't put in too much effort, the answer comes when you step back and have a look.
