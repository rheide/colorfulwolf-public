Scandinavia, which counts as North Europe is among the most sparsely populated countries in the world. There are more people in Singapore than the whole of Finland. A recent study has also shown scandinavians to be a pretty happy bunch(http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/06/world-happiness-report-2012_n_1408787.html). <br/><br/>Perhaps if you'd lived in Tokyo and had to commute your opinions of Japan would be different. See here - <br/>http://www.businessinsider.com/tokyo-metro-commuter-hell-2012-1?op=1 <br/>It gives a whole new meaning to herd mentality. <br/><br/>I'm sure you're not the only one to think about moving to less populated areas. Eventually, those places that were once empty will become busy. The planet is already busting at the seams and everyone in existence today will be dead by the time if and when Mars becomes a viable option. <br/><br/>Take home message - Either way, we're fucked."}, {"author": "randy", "date": "2013-01-16 09:17:15", "content": "You do make a good point about Scandinavia (despite being a smart arse). Do you think that maybe there's a relation between those countries being empty as fuck and the people who live there being happy? Second caveat: even in an empty country, people will still gather together in big cities, so having a low population count doesn't necessarily mean that the population density in cities is low. (Though I don't know if that's the case for Scandinavia)."}, {"author": "Smart Arse", "date": "2013-01-16 09:49:39", "content": "Yes, Reykjavik is a massive city choc full of people."}]}
