I am Christopher (Chris) from Prince Edward Island, Canada. I found your blog when I searched for blogging programmers. I've been reading your blog for more than a month! I enjoy your perspectives and I'm glad you continue writing as you do.<br/><br/>When your hard drive fried it was perhaps only the circuitry of the disk and not the platters that were damaged. If this is the case, your data may be intact. You could purchase an identical drive and do some surgery - swap the platters from the burnt hard drive into the new one. You may be able to access the data that way."}, {"author": "rheide", "date": "2009-06-04 09:08:45", "content": "Thanks for your suggestion :) I've considered it actually. It would be much cheaper than approaching a data recovery  program, and I could probably get my data out alive, or at least I will be able to reproduce what I've lost when I get a list of files out. Fortunately this drive did not (yet) contain much important information, so rather than risking another broken disk I've decided to use the backup instead.<br/><br/>(replacement drives arriving tomorrow :D )"}]}
