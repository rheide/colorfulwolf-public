Probably it's because looking out of the window from the 15th floor right now, i can't spot a single power line. Then again, this leaves plenty of room for tees and stuff. I prefer urban look and feel though.<br/><br/>Also, you used the word \"nice\" six times in this post, I declare that a sign that you will enjoy the next days."}, {"author": "Alex", "date": "2010-04-27 14:27:29", "content": "I recommend going back to Gion at night, when the rich people go out for a drink. I though there was a striking difference between the \"Old Rich\" Japan of Gion and the \"New Rich\" of bling-bling Tokyo; the small private clubs, the well dressed people, the soft light and small alleys, the canal.<br/><br/>I know you've probably visited many placed in Kyoto, but if you haven't visited the Kenninji Zen temple, I wholeheartedly recommend it. I would say that it's my favorite place in Japan (not kidding). If I could live there, wearing big robes and woolen socks, and just look at the rocks and garden and drag my feet on the used soft wooden floors, I would.
