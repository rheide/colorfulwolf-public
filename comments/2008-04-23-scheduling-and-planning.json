I stumbled upon your blog when I googled names from participants to the Asahi-Kasei internship programme. I'm trying to get in touch with you about the speech recognition internship you did at Asahi Kasei. I've been selected to work on the french engine and I'd like to ask you few questions if you don't mind.<br/><br/>Can you please email me ASAP, that is before friday =( , at cassiusg@gmail.com? Thanks in advance!<br/><br/>Cheers<br/><br/>Matthieu Lux"}, {"author": "Matthieu", "date": "2008-04-30 13:23:15", "content": "Hey Randy, What are you doing for Queen's day, today??<br/>You should go drinking with fellow Dutch people :p"}, {"author": "Kamil", "date": "2008-05-04 18:23:32", "content": "I am utterly confused!! :)"}]}
