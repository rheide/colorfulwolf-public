I ran across this as a \"possibly related\" blog to my blog (rokusan.wordpress.com), which is a hodgepodge of stories about life as a foreigner, in Japan.<br/><br/>Your first year there sounds like an adventure. Are you still there, two years later? The thing I found most striking about Japan is that, even years after you leave it, it never leaves you.<br/><br/>I hope you had many more excellent and fun experiences in Japan. Best wishes ~"}]}
