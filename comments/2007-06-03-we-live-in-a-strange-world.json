Nothing has really changed - its always the same people, same place - but all that has changed is the distance of people.<br/><br/>Always start searching from within yourself before searching from others because most of the time the answer is inside yourself. Everything external can aid you but cannot give you the answer.<br/><br/>We all really only care about ourselves at the end - so if it is happiness you are searching for, let you start from yourself because if you are happy then everything and everyone around you will follow :D<br/><br/>Don't expect!"}]}
