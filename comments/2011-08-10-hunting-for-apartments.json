And it was in the very center.<br/><br/>I just bought my own appartment 5min away from the Grand place (city center), 110m\u00b2!!<br/><br/>Do not think I would be able to leave in less than 50m\u00b2 anymore... It is quite fun to hear my friends living in Paris \"Just left my 35m\u00b2 for a 'big' 50m\u00b2 appartment\". Glad I do not leave in Paris or London. Rent is ridiculous there.<br/><br/>Well good luck for your house hunting. Should try to visit London one of those days to see you and Kamil!"}, {"author": "randy", "date": "2011-08-16 14:20:37", "content": "Nice! Yeah, come by in London, that sounds like an awesome plan. We can drink and let Kamil drive us home :D"}]}
