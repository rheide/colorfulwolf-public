They're also relative, of course.<br/><br/>Now that I've been in China for a few weeks, I can say that my time spent in Japan was more comfortable (aesthetics, foam mattresses :), and while the convenience stores there were, well, convenient... the prices of the same goods in China are no contest. For the simple reason that RMB is undervalued against USD, I've been eating and drinking to my heart's content for a mere pittance compared to other modern(izing) societies.<br/><br/>I can say that I'm getting more and more \"comfortable\" with being surrounded by trash, rubble, and dilapidated buildings. From a functional perspective, it's \"good enough.\" And my living space is much more accommodating than the apartment in Japan. I have more rooms than I could use... anyone want to visit? ;)<br/><br/>Of course, what I find comfortable could just as well be unbearable to the next person. Much like your neighbor's smoking habit :/"}]}
