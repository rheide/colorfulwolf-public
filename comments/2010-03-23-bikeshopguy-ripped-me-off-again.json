Weird."}, {"author": "boris", "date": "2010-03-24 11:27:33", "content": "Hey, maybe the bikeshopguy was right when he told you also to replace the sprocket. Problem is, that after years of usage chain and sprocket show some abrasion. When you now only change the chain, it will skip because the sprocket doesn't fit the new one. That's because of abrasion of the sprocket teeth. Can you understand what I want to tell you?! So whenever you have a really old pair of chain and sprocket, change both parts, otherwise you will run into problems."}, {"author": "rheide", "date": "2010-03-24 11:31:29", "content": "You are of course right, and I have no choice but to change both parts. It's still an unexpected expense though, and I've been having too much of those lately :("}]}
