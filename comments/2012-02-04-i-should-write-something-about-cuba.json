In a local economy business have to provide quality if they want to remain in business, because most customers are returning customers. Most tourists are not going to be returning customers so for the  business owner the short term optimal decision is to extract as much value as possible from a customer and be as aggressive as possible in trying to get customers. In the long run it hurts the whole tourism economy, but he doesn't gain anything/not much if he is the only one being fair to customers and he doesn't lose anything if he's the only one who is not fair."}]}
