The mouse is still there. It stares at me sometimes, but before I can do anything it runs away. I've concocted this new mouse trap:

The mouse is really smart though, I'm not sure if it will fall for it. Somehow it's managed to keep itself alive without springing any traps. I'm pretty sure it ate quite a bit of the poison pellets I've been scattering around, yet it's still not dead. Perhaps this will prove more fruitful.
