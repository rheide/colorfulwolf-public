The weather in Iceland did not favor us. We were there for 6 nights and only one of them was clear enough to see the aurora. I was surprised at how little of it you can actually see in real life. I'm not very happy with my photos, but they show the aurora as stronger than you could see it with your own eyes. Still, very impressive. I must see it again so I can take better pictures.

This was taken in the south of Iceland. The day before this we were in the north and it was freezing cold, almost too much so to be outside at all. Fortunately for us this day it was only a few degrees below zero.

Incredible, what a sight.
