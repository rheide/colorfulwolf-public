I haven't blogged much lately because I've been censoring myself. A couple of years ago I would write the most embarassing stuff on here and wouldn't look back on it after posting. Right now I feel uncomfortable with the thoughts I am thinking, and I don't consider them fit for sharing. Perhaps that in itself is the message I should be sharing, so here you go.

It was sunny today, and I had a great walk outside. Even Ealing seemed nice in the clear blue sky. It didn't last long, of course, this being London and all. There's definitely a correlation between the color of the sky and my mood. If only I had time and money to spend on Moodlogger then I'd actually be able to prove that.

One month until the big holiday. I'm actually going away next week on a short trip. After that I have to get rid of all my stuff and prepare for the big trip. You wouldn't believe how much I am looking forward to going back to Japan. It's probably unhealthy. People keep telling me that it might not be as good as I remember. I <strong>know</strong> it will be just as good as I remember. It'll be good because it's memorable.

More later, when I am in the right mindset to write a coherent blogpost. Not yet.
