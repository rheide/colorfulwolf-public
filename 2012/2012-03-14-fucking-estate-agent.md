My estate agent is the most horrible evil bitchwoman that ever lived. When I was looking at apartments I asked her specifically for an apartment that had an existing internet connection that would work at the day of moving on. She told me it did have such an internet connection because the previous tenant had it, and I would be able to use it and transfer it to my name. The day I moved in there was no such thing. I should have taken this as a warning and just cancelled the deal because the woman is a fucking snake. Last year I tried for months to pick up a copy of my rental contract and every time she made a different excuse. It was over 3 months later when I finally got it..

Then today she casually calls me to let me know that an electrician will be coming over in 5 minutes to check the electricity. She said "He'll let himself in, don't worry about the mess.". Um, no, bitch, I'm working from home today and I need my internet connection. You can't just turn it off. The damn electrician arrived and I am hardly able to converse with him because he doesn't really speak English, but it's not his fault, it's the estate agent's fault. As I am typing this I am on my laptop and managed to get my tethered internet connection working.

I am surprised by the audacity of this horrible person. Every single time I have to deal with her I immediately get annoyed. There is no other person on this planet who is this far removed from being a reasonable human being. ARGH, so annoyed right now..
