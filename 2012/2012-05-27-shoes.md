Bought these shoes the other day: <a href="http://www.merrell.com/UK/en-GB/Product.mvc.aspx/23456M/52217/Mens/Barefoot-Run-Trail-Glove">http://www.merrell.com/UK/en-GB/Product.mvc.aspx/23456M/52217/Mens/Barefoot-Run-Trail-Glove</a> . Am in love-hate relationship. When worn they feel great, but somehow can't get myself to put them on. Also, they chafe my ankles sometimes. I wish I could find my old brown Adidas shoes that I used to have in Japan..
