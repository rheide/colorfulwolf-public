This photo was made last year in the same season, but it could just as easily have been made yesterday.

Being in the forest here brings me peace. The forest is not unique in this, of course; there's many places in the world that bring me peace. I've realized that London is not one of them. Life is hectic there, and ugly. It's also interesting and lively and I can't do without either. I loved Japan because I didn't have to choose: I could have countryside peace or cityside liveliness whenever I wanted. It is my goal to be in a similar situation again in the future.

I've reconciled with Holland. I do still feel as if I've outgrown it, but I can appreciate it better now. In the right amount, it's an awesome place to visit.

My mind is clear again. Now I can look towards the future.
