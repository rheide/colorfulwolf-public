It's 7:30AM and I'm exhausted. Yesterday another friend arrived so we went out for drinks and visited Times Square and Rockefeller Plaza. It was about 1:30AM when I arrived back at my hotel, only to find my bed occupied by a French person, so I had to take the top bunk bed. The room got massively hot because the French guy turned off the airconditioning which he found too noisy. Then his phone rang several times during the night, waking me up. I will be very sleepy today.

Times Square is amazing. You can somehow feel the energy there. It also seems relatively safe. I guess I'm paying more attention to that since we got robbed in Lisbon. When there's tons of people around it seems safe, and there's hidden police as well. I looked around for suspicious people trying to pickpocket but did not find any.Even taking the subway home at 12:30AM felt fine and there were still lots of people about.

There's a lot of things to see in New York. I'm in no rush to make up my mind.
