If you care about Cuba and its people, do not go there and fuel their corrupt economy with your tourist money. Cuba needs a revolution to bring it up to speed with the rest of the world.

If you don't care about Cuba, then go and see a unique culture the likes of which will never appear in this world again. You will not be disappointed if you go.

This blog here will tell you more about Cuba than I ever could:Â <a href="http://www.desdecuba.com/generationy/">http://www.desdecuba.com/generationy/</a>
