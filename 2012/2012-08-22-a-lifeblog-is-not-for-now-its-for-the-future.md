The concept of lifeblogging should be familiar to anyone who reads this blog. I write whatever is in my head at the moment. Yet that's exactly what I haven't been doing the past year, and I regret it. Perhaps I've been bored on some occasions, but to write nothing is wrong. Because in the future I will have forgotten entirely what I did that year, and without a blog entry to guide my memory I won't be able to recall what I was doing in the past.Â Blog posts and photos. Those are the guiding threads of memory.

<strong>Log your life. Your future self will thank you for it.</strong>
