(random brainfarts)

Today I stayed at work for about 10 hours. Why? No particular reason, other than that I couldn't think of what else to do with my day. Which is ridiculous because the day before I was very excited when I came home because I knew I had so many cool movies to watch, interesting articles to read and fun games to play. This must be the first sign of something bad. I've taken steps to fix it. Tomorrow I'll be working from home for a couple of hours and then I'll go out. I don't know where yet, I don't know what I'll do. It's possible that it'll be rainy and shitty, but then I'll go to a caf√© somewhere. Otherwise, I'll go for a nice long walk. Sometimes I forgot to do this. Hopefully I won't forget again.

I'm still looking for an apartment. The search for a two-bedroom for me and my friend has become exhausting to the point that I'm ready to give up without even having viewed a single apartment. None of them are good. It's not a matter of quality. I could live perfectly well in a shitty apartment, and god knows I've seen a lot of them while searching online. But it's the price that people ask for it. I just don't want to have to pay shitloads of money to live in shit. I realize that bargains (low price, high quality) can't be found, but at the very least I must be able to find a low-price-low-quality place or a medium-price-medium-quality place, right? This week will be the last of the two-bedroom searches. Next week I'll move on to studios.
