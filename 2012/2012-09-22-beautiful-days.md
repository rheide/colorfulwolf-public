Today is another beautiful blue day. The weather in London has been contrary to its reputation lately, much to my advantage. This is a snap of a residential street near where I live. As you get closer to the subway station the neighbourhood rapidly deteriorates into a wretched hive of scum and villainy. But out where I live it's not too bad.

The reason  I went out today is the cold. The people I'm staying with are, to say the very least, peculiar. They're very nice and they're great at leaving me alone, something I much prefer. But they pretty much keep the heating off because "it's still summer". As a result I felt too cold to comfortably work in my room so I went to a local café instead. My intention was to deal with my taxes and finances, but after I arrived I realized that I forgot to bring my internet banking login things. Oh well. I guess I'll just do what I can.

I've been toying with the idea of integrating my twitter posts and facebook posts into this blog, perhaps as another column on the side, perhaps with some form of security measure for the facebook stuff that I only want my friends to see. The longer I have a presence on the internet, the more I feel the need to gather up my 'influence' in a single location. Facebook and Twitter won't last forever. Before you know it they'll become unpopular and get taken over by another company which just happens to misplace a backup and ends up losing all your data. I prefer to be in charge of my internet history myself. Now all I need is some free time..
