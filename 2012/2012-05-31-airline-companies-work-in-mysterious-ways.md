So, I booked a flight to Japan (yay!) with British Airways. I went onto kayak.com and found the cheapest flight I could find, which was (iirc) 540GBP. The catch is: this flight begins in Amsterdam, not in London, even though there's a transfer in London. The cheapest flight direct from London was over 700 pounds.

So I booked the cheap Amsterdam flight, since it's still way cheaper for me to fly to Amsterdam one day, then take a plane back to London the next day. It's basically a free trip to Holland. I did try to call BA today to see if I could cancel the first flight from Amsterdam to London to see if I could skip the silly round trip, but that was not possible. The person I spoke to told me that I had a 'special action price ticket' something or other, and the only way for me to start the trip in London would be to re-book at normal prices, which would cost over 1000 pounds.

I tried to point out how silly this was to her, and that BA would actually make <strong>more </strong>money if they accepted my flight's cancellation and try to sell it to someone else, but they wouldn't listen. Bureaucracy I guess. Or they just really really want to prevent English people from going to Japan. Weird.
