I'm just so tired right now I can't be bothered to write the post I was about to write. I'm fed up, really. So just take my word for it. Never trust middle men, ever. Be quick to trust friends, be quick to drop the trust when they betray it. In Japan, trust strangers. In London, don't. Don't become cynical. If you are emotionally unable to recognize when to trust people, then you have a problem and you should get help. Trust is what allows you to enjoy life. Trust that everything will be ok. Trust that no one will steal your bicycle or your backpack. Do not lose your trust after one bad experience. Don't let the world win. You can be better than all those people who do not deserve your trust. Don't give up. Be better.
