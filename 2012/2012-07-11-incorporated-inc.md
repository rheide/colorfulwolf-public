Well, I own a company now. Somehow I managed to ignore the entire issue for almost a year and managed to just be self-employed, but now I've finally taken the plunge and got an accountant. <a href="http://www.crunch.co.uk/" target="_blank">Crunch</a> got my company up and running in three days flat, and I'm very happy about that. I'm not sure what instigated the sudden action on my part. I had the whole year to get it done yet somehow I'm doing it in the final two weeks before I go on a long holiday. Ugh.

I'm not quite done yet. There's still a business bank account to get and all the billing stuff to set up. But soon I will be paying myself a salary.

On an entirely unrelated note: does anyone know where I can buy a good touring bicycle in Japan? I want one with rear <strong>and </strong>front luggage rack.
