How annoying. As I was cycling on the exercise bike indoors, I had yet to realize that someone has taken away my bicycle some time between last night and this afternoon. If you see this bicycle anywhere in London please let me know at mrhazard [at] gmail (.com). There's only two of them in London and I know for a fact that the other one is owned by my friend. Here's the most recent pic I could find.
