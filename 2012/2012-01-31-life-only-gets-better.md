<div>There is not going to be any death, there is not going to be any famine. There is not going to be any plague that will threaten to kill everyone. I am not in danger of dying any time soon, and medical science will make great leaps forward during my lifetime. I am earning a fair amount of money now but I can only expect to get richer I the future. There is nothing that could possibly threaten my future if I continue living the way that I do. By the time I am 80 welfare will have increased unimaginably much compared to now. This moment, this very moment, is financially, technologically and medically the worst moment of my life for countless of years to come. That is why I must enjoy this moment the most, because it will never come again.
