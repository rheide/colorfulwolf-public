My estate agent just called me to let me know that she won't be able to make it today, exactly as I predicted yesterday. She said she had to bring her children to school. On Saturday when she was checking the room I asked her in person THREE FUCKING TIMES if she would be able to make it on Monday, and she said yes. Incompetent.

Anyway, she's going to check the room after I've left it, meaning she'll have every chance to throw weird allegations at me and do evil things to try and keep my money. Therefore I took photos of my apartment last night and posted them online here: <a href="https://www.colorfulwolf.com/pics/apt20120723" target="_blank">https://www.colorfulwolf.com/pics/apt20120723</a>. If you care about my situation please download these photos and leave a comment so that I have some evidence that I actually left the room like this. I realize this is not much in the way of evidence and I have no idea if it will hold up in court, but I need to cover every single base because this woman could seriously screw me over if she was so inclined.

Argh. At least I don't have to see that annoying face of her again.
