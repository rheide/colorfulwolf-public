It's dreary outside. Fortunately for me the rain stopped just long enough for me to make a round trip to the post office, which is about 6km away when taking the hidden paths only meant for bicycles. Unfortunately for me that path was flooded and I had to take the long way round. It was a good cycle nevertheless, and I am happy to have gone out.

I should probably write a year-end reflection blogpost or something. Maybe later.
