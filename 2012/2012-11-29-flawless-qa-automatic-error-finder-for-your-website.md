<strong>Your website. Flawless.</strong>

Today is the day I get to reveal what we've been working on for the past two weeks. And here it is: <a href="http://www.flawless.qa/" target="_blank">Flawless.QA</a> is a service that automatically checks pages on your website and notifies you via e-mail about mistakes whenever there's an update. The mistakes that we can currently detect are spelling and grammar errors, and broken links, but we're working on extending that.

At the moment we only do about one check per day, roughly. We're already making plans to improve upon this in the future, but we wanted to get our idea out to the public as soon as possible. Please give it a try, and let us know what you think. I promise I'll reply to you personally if you mention this blogpost ;)
