And I survived :D

More later, a bit tired now. Many photos were taken. My crappy old bike is doing great, even though it's only got one gear. I managed to time things so I rode back along the coast during sunset, which was great fun. There's always so much stuff going on there. People playing games on the beach, surfing, swimming, playing music, walking weird dogs, playing with weird children..

Anyway, sleep.
