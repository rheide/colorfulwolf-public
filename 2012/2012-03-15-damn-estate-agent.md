So today the electrician decided to just enter my place without my permission while I was at work. The estate agent didn't bother to call me this time, I guess because I requested a timely notification (as in, NOT 5 FUCKING MINUTES BEFORE). So I came home today and I find all my things moved to different places. Great work, fucking evil estate agent woman. You're really making me feel comfortable here. I need to set up a fucking webcam for this shit..

ROT IN HELL, WOMAN
