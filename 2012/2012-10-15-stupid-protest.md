This is a large group of people asking out to please limit freedom of speech. The protest is supposed to be peaceful, but the underlying threat is clear. If this many people can gather around just for a peaceful protest, then how many will show up next time when it turns to violence? Because it will turn to that next time, due to the small group of radicals inside the large group. And then a small group of stupid white trash chavs will retaliate. And all this because the muslims couldn't target the real offender: the people who made the movie. And by that I mean the people who corrupted it onto something hateful, not the <a href="http://www.woroni.com.au/comment/i-feel-shattered-innocence-of-muslims-actress-speaks-out/" target="_blank">actors</a>.

Free speech offends people. Deal with it.
