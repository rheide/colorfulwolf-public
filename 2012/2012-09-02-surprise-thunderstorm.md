The weather looked fine when I left: some dark clouds in the distance, but moving in the right direction. When I arrived at the seaside I found that a new front of dark clouds had moved in behind me. Halfway on the way back I entered into the worst tropical rainstorm ever. Well, perhaps not the worst, the one in Okinawa was worse, and I've had some worse days during my cycling trip two years ago. But this was the first time in Atsugi that I actually ventured out in this kind of weather. It felt rather extreme, yet enjoyable. Arriving back at the hotel, soaking wet, the receptionists had the best look of shock on her face that I will not soon forget. A day well spent.
