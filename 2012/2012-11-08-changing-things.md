I'm too tired to write this in a nice way. Last Sunday I came back from a great trip to Dorset. The next day, I quit my job and announced to my boss that I'm planning to do a startup with my friend Brian. We don't have an idea yet. It must be premature to quit your job when you don't know what you're going to be doing, but it seems like the right thing to do to me.

This weekend is <a href="http://angelhack.com/" target="_blank">Angelhack</a>. Some Potato friends, Brian and I have registered to participate. We're fairly sure of what to build, but still pivoting at the last moment. A lot of things can happen. I'm going to be thinking about startups every evening after work, since Brian is staying at my place. Work is a ton of coding as well, and Angelhack this weekend will be a 24 hour coding marathon. I feel a brain explosion coming up.

So many ideas. So much more to come.
