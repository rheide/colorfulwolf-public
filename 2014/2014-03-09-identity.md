I have a confession to make: the pseudonymous blog experiment is a failure. Two reasons:
<ul>
	<li>There are too many things I cannot mention or have to be vague about in order to remain pseudonymous. Just like my on real blog, I find myself limited in the things that I am able to say, but for entirely different reasons.</li>
	<li>Most (if not all) of the things I wrote pseudonymously in the past four months are topics that I would not mind having my real name attached to. In fact, for some of the topics I wrote about, having my real name attached to it would benefit me in real life, as they are about technology and would help promote me as a programmer.</li>
</ul>
The reason that this blog, the real blog, has been offline for so long is because my free trial on Amazon EC2 finally ended. Having already decided that I wouldn't blog here any longer I decided to take the site offline for the time being, while working on a static version that I could host on S3. I never got around to that though.

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">When faced with the choice of statically perserving the site, or keeping it active and allowing myself to blog with my real identity, it was pretty clear what I wanted. So here we are! Back in business! :)Â </span>
